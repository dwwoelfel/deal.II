Minor:

* The documentation

  - Update FAQ hyperlinks to point to googlegroups
    (WB: actually, no -- this is a change that should happen on
     mainline once we have migrated the whole wiki)

* The following feature has to be written: TECPLOT

* Fixup the TODOs in
    source/lac/sparse_dircect.cc
    source/base/path_find.cc
    source/base/function_parser.cc
