Next steps:

* The original decision to have a dedicated p4est/FAST and p4est/DEBUG
  structure is a bit unfortunate and therefor replaced by a FindP4EST
  module that searches libp4est.so and treats this as FAST and
  libp4est_debug.so or libp4est.g.so and treats this as debug library.
  TODO: Update the p4est-setup.sh script...

* Add the compiler dependent CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS magic.

* Add Bug tests

* HDF5

* PETSC

* MUMPS

* SLEPC

* HSL ???

* TECPLOT ???
