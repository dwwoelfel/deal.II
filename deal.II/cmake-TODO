TODO:

* What to do with ./lib/meshes ? I have moved it to ./contrib/meshes for
  the time being...

* Think once more about the correct place for ./scripts ...

* Add build and installation of the documentation

* The original decision to have a dedicated p4est/FAST and p4est/DEBUG
  structure is a bit unfortunate and therefor replaced by a FindP4EST
  module that searches libp4est.so and treats this as FAST and
  libp4est_debug.so or libp4est.g.so and treats this as debug library.
  TODO: Update the p4est-setup.sh script...

* Check whether p4est mpi support matches the deal.II mpi support.

* Reenable support for metis versions 4.x ?!

* Add the Bug tests

* The following features have to be written:
    * HDF5
    * PETSC
    * MUMPS
    * SLEPC
    * HSL
    * TECPLOT
