This tutorial program presents the implementation of a hybridizable
discontinuous Galkerin method for the convection-diffusion equation.

<h3>  Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods</h3>

One common argument against the use of discontinuous Galerkin elements
is the large number of globally coupled degrees of freedom that one
must solve in an implicit system.  For the FE_DGP_Monomial basis, each 
scalar solution component is represented by polynomials of degree p
which yields $(1/dim!)*\prod_{i=1}^{dim}(k+i)$ degrees of freedom per
element.  Typically, all degrees of freedom in an element are coupled
to all of the degrees of freedom in the adjacent elements.  The resulting
discrete equations yield very large linear systems very quickly, especially
for systems of equations in dim=2 or dim=3.  

<h4> Reducing the size of the linear system </h4>
To alleviate the computational cost of solving such large linear systems, 
the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methodology has recently been 
developed by Cockburn and co-workers 
(<b>
   N.C. Nguyen and J. Peraire:
   <i>Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for partial differential 
   equations in continuum mechanics</i>, Journal of Computational Physics,
   2012, 231:18, 5955-5988.
   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2012.02.033">[DOI]</a>
</b>).
The HDG method achieves
this goal by formulating the mathematical problem using Dirichlet-to-Neumann
mappings.  The partial differential equations are first written as a first
order system, and each field is then discretized via a DG method.  At this
point the  single-valued ``trace'' values on the skeleton of the
mesh, i.e. element edges, are taken to be independent unknown quantities.  
The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map concept then permits the solution procedure:
<ol>
  <li> Solve a Dirichlet problem on each element individually, where the local/interior
element solutions no longer couple to neighboring elements.  This is known as the
'local solver', and is an <i>embarrassingly parallel</i> element-by-element 
solution process.
  <li>  Use the local element equations to construct the global problem for the 
trace values.  These are the only globally coupled unknowns.
  <li>  Solve for the element-local solutions using the computed trace values.
</ol>

The above procedure also has a linear algebra interpretation and is referred to
as static condensation. Let us write the complete linear system associated to
the HDG problem as a block system with the discrete DG variables <i>U</i> as
first block and the skeleton variables $\Lambda$ as the second block:
@f{eqnarray*}
\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} U \\ \Lambda \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} F \\ G \end{pmatrix}
@f}
Our aim is now to eliminate the <i>U</i> block with a Schur complement
approach similar to step-20, which results in the following two steps:
@f{eqnarray*}
(D - C A^{-1} B) \Lambda &=& G - C A^{-1} F \\
A U &=& F - B \Lambda
@f}
The steps in the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map concept hence correspond to
<ol>
  <li> constructing the Schur complement matrix $D-C A^{-1} B$ and right hand side $G - C A^{-1} F$,
  <li> solving the Schur complement system for $\Lambda$, and
  <li> solving the equation for <i>U</i> using the second equation which uses $\Lambda$.
</ol>

The important ingredient from the linear algebra point of view is that the
matrix <i>A</i> is block-diagonal with block size equal to the number of
degrees of freedom of the interior DG variables which are always only related
to a single cell. The coupling to other cells is introduced by the matrices
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i> over the skeleton variable. The block-diagonality of
<i>A</i> and the structure in <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> allow us to invert the
matrix <i>A</i> element by element (the local solution of the Dirichlet
problem) and subtract $CA^{-1}B$ from $D$.

<h4> Solution quality and rates of convergence</h4>
Another criticism of traditional DG methods is that the approximate fluxes
converge suboptimally.  The local HDG solutions can be shown to converge
as $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$, i.e., at optimal order.  Additionally, a super-convergence property can 
be used to post-process a new approximate solution that converges at the 
rate $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+2})$.



<h3> HDG applied to the convection-diffusion problem </h3>

The HDG formulation used for this example is taken from

<b>
  N.C. Nguyen, J. Peraire, B. Cockburn:
  <i>An implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method 
  for linear convectionâ€“diffusion equations</i>, 
  Journal of Computational Physics, 2009, 228:9, 3232-3254.

We consider the convection-diffusion equation:
@f{eqnarray*}
	\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{c} u) - \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) &=& f,
	\quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
	u &=& g_D, \quad \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D, \\
	(\mathbf{c} u - \kappa \nabla u)\cdot \mathbf{n} &=& g_N, 
	\quad \text{ on }  \partial \Omega_N.
@f}

Introduce the auxiliary variable $\mathbf{q}=-\kappa \nabla u$ and rewrite
the above equation as the first order system:
@f{eqnarray*}
  \mathbf{q} + \kappa \nabla u &=& 0, \quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
  \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{c} u + \mathbf{q}) &=& f, \quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
  u &=& g_D, \quad \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D, \\
  (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{c}u)\cdot\mathbf{n}  &=& g_N, 
	\quad \text{ on }  \partial \Omega_N.
@f}

We multiply these equations by the weight functions $\mathbf{v}, w$ 
and integrate by parts over every element $K$ to obtain:
@f{eqnarray*}
  (\kappa^{-1} \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{v})_K - (u, \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v})_K
    + <\hat{u}, \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}>_{\partial K} &=& 0, \\
  - (\mathbf{c} u + \mathbf{q}, \nabla w)_K 
    + <(\hat{\mathbf{c} u}+\hat{\mathbf{q}})\cdot\mathbf{n}, w>_{\partial K}
    &=& (f,w)_K.
@f}

The terms decorated with a $\hat{}$ denote the numerical traces (also commonly referred
to as numerical fluxes).   They are approximations
to the interior values on the boundary of the element.  To ensure conservation, 
these terms must be single-valued on any given element edge $\partial K$.
We eliminate the numerical trace $\hat{\mathbf{q}}$ by using traces of the form:
@f{eqnarray*}
  \hat{\mathbf{c} u}+\hat{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{c}\hat{u} + \mathbf{q}
  + \tau(u - \hat{u})\mathbf{n} \quad \text{ on } \partial K.
@f}
The local stabilization parameter $\tau$ has effects on stability and accuracy of 
HDG solutions; see the literature for a further discussion.

The trace/skeleton variables in HDG methods are single-valued on element faces.  As such,
they must strongly represent the Dirichlet data on $\partial\Omega_D$.  We introduce
a new variable $\lambda$ such that
@f{equation*}
  \hat{u} = 
  \begin{cases}
     g_D  & \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D, \\
     \lambda & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
@f} 

Eliminating $\hat{u}$ from the weak form in favor of $\lambda$, summing the elemental
contributions across all elements in the triangulation, and enforcing the normal
component of the numerical flux, we arrive at the final form of the problem:  
Find $(\mathbf{q}, u, \lambda)$ such that
@f{eqnarray*}
  (\kappa^{-1} \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{v})_{\mathcal{T}}
    - (u, \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v})_{\mathcal{T}}
    + <\lambda, \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}>_{\partial\mathcal{T}}
    &=&
    - <g_D, \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}>_{\partial\Omega_D},
\\
  - (\mathbf{c} u + \mathbf{q}, \nabla w)_{\mathcal{T}}
    + <(\hat{\mathbf{c}u} + \hat{\mathbf{q}})\cdot\mathbf{n}, w>_{\partial \mathcal{T}}
    &=&
    (f, w)_{\mathcal{T}},
\\
  < \left[ \negthinspace \left[ (\hat{\mathbf{c}u} + \hat{\mathbf{q}})\cdot\mathbf{n}
    \right] \negthinspace \right], \mu>_{\partial \mathcal{T}}
    &=&
    <g_N, \mu>_{\partial\Omega_N}
@f}
