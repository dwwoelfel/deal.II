<h1>Introduction</h1>

This tutorial program presents the implementation of a hybridizable
discontinuous Galkerin method for the convection-diffusion equation.

<h3>  Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods</h3>

One common argument against the use of discontinuous Galerkin elements
is the large number of globally coupled degrees of freedom that one
must solve in an implicit system.  For the FE_DGP_Monomial basis, each 
scalar solution component is represented by polynomials of degree p
which yields $(1/dim!)*\prod_{i=1}^{dim}(k+i)$ degrees of freedom per
element.  Typically, all degrees of freedom in an element are coupled
to all of the degrees of freedom in the adjacent elements.  The resulting
discrete equations yield very large linear systems very quickly, especially
for systems of equations in dim=2 or dim=3.  

To alleviate the computational cost of solving such large linear systems, 
the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methodology has recently been 
developed by Cockburn and co-workers

   equations in continuum mechanics</i>, Journal of Computational Physics,

</b>).
The HDG method achieves
this goal by formulating the mathematical problem using Dirichlet-to-Neumann
mappings.  The partial differential equations are first written as a first
order system, and each field is then discretized via a DG method.  At this
point the  single-valued ``trace'' values on the skeleton of the
mesh, i.e. element edges, are taken to be independent unknown quantities.  
The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map concept then permits the solution procedure:
<ol>
  <li> Solve a Dirichlet problem on each element individually, where the local/interior
element solutions no longer couple to neighboring elements.  This is known as the
'local solver', and is an <i>embarrissingly parallel</i> element-by-element 
solution process.
  <li>  Use the local element solutions to construct the global problem for the 
trace values.  These are the only globally coupled unknowns.
  <li>  Modify the local solutions from the computed trace values.
</ol>

Another criticism of traditional DG methods is that the approximate fluxes
converge suboptimally.   The local HDG solutions can be shown to converge
as $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$.  Additionally, a super-convergence property can 
be used to post-process a new approximate solution that converges at the 
rate $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+2})$.



<h3> HDG applied to the convection-diffusion problem </h3>

The HDG formulation used for this example is taken from

  <i>An implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method 
  for linear convectionâ€“diffusion equations</i>,

We consider the convection-diffusion equation:
@f{eqnarray*}
	\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{c} u) - \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) &=& f,
	\quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
	u &=& g_D, \quad \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D, \\
	(\mathbf{c} u - \kappa \nabla u)\cdot \mathbf{n} &=& g_N, 
	\quad \text{ on }  \partial \Omega_D.
@f}

Introduce the auxiliary variable $\mathbf{q}=-\kappa \nabla u$ and rewrite
the above equation as the first order system:
@f{eqnarray*}
  \mathbf{q} + \kappa \nabla u &=& 0, \quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
  \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{c} u + \mathbf{q}) &=& f, \quad \text{ in } \Omega, \\
  u &=& g_D, \quad \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D, \\
  (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{c}u)\cdot\mathbf{n}  &=& g_N, 
	\quad \text{ on }  \partial \Omega_D.

<h3> Problem specific data </h3>
Example specific data:
$\Omega := [-1,1]^d$

\f[
\mathbf{c} = \begin{cases}
1, & \textrm{dim}=1 \\
(y, -x), & \textrm{dim}=2 \\
(y, -x, 1), & \textrm{dim}=3
\end{cases}
\f]

the centers $x_i$ of the exponentials are 
  $\{x_i\}_1^3 = \{ -\frac{1}{3}, 0, \frac{1}{3} \}$
  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_1^3 = \{ (-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})
  							 (-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2})
  							 (\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2})
  						  \}$
  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_1^3 = \{ (-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4})
  							 (-\frac{3}{5},-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{8})
  							 (\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})
  						  \}$
