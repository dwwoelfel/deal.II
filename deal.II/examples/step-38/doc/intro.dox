<h1>This will be an example of the new MeshWorker framework and will be available soon</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This example is devoted to the <em>discontinuous Galerkin method</em>,
or in short: DG method. It solves the same problem as step-12 (see
there for a description of the problem and discretization), but here
we use the MeshWorker framework in order to save reprogramming the
cell/face loops.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
