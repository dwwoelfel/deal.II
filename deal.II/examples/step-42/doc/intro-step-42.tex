\section{Introduction}

This example is an extension of step-41, considering a contact problem with an
elasto-plastic material behavior with isotropic hardening in three dimensions.
That means that we have to take care of an additional nonlinearity: the
material behavior. Since we consider a three dimensional problem here, a
separate difference to step-41 is that the contact area is at the boundary of
the deformable body now, rather than in the interior. Finally, compared to
step-41, we also have to deal with
hanging nodes because of the adaptive mesh in both the handling of the linear
system as well as of the inequality constraints; in the latter case, we will
have to deal with prioritizing whether the constraints from the hanging nodes
or from the inequalities are more important.

Since you can very easily reach a few million degrees of freedom in three
dimensions, even with adaptive mesh refinement, we decided to use Trilinos and
p4est to run our code in parallel, building on the framework of step-40 for
the parallelization.

\section{Classical formulation}

The classical formulation of the problem possesses the following form:
\begin{align*}
 \varepsilon(u) &= A\sigma + \lambda & &\quad\text{in } \Omega,\\
 \lambda(\tau - \sigma) &\geq 0\quad\forall\tau\text{ with
 }\mathcal{F}(\tau)\leq 0 & &\quad\text{in } \Omega,\\
 -\textrm{div}\ \sigma &= f & &\quad\text{in } \Omega,\\
 u(\mathbf x) &= 0 & &\quad\text{on }\Gamma_D,\\
 \sigma_t(u) &= 0,\quad\sigma_n(u)\leq 0 & &\quad\text{on }\Gamma_C,\\
\sigma_n(u)(u_n - g) &= 0,\quad u_n(\mathbf x) - g(\mathbf x) \leq 0 & &\quad\text{on } \Gamma_C
\end{align*}
with $u\in H^2(\Omega),\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$.  The vector valued
function $u$ denotes the displacement in the deformable body. The first two lines describe the
elasto-plastic material behavior. Therein the equation shows the
strain of the deformation $\varepsilon (u)$ as the additive decomposition of the
elastic part $A\sigma$ and the plastic part $\lambda$. $A$ is defined as the compliance tensor of fourth order which contains some material constants and $\sigma$ as the
symmetric stress tensor of second order. So we have to consider the inequality in the second
row component-by-component and furthermore we have to distinguish two cases.\\
The continuous and convex function $\mathcal{F}$ denotes the von Mises flow function
$$\mathcal{F}(\tau) = \vert\tau^D\vert - \sigma_0,\quad \tau^D = \tau -
\dfrac{1}{3}tr(\tau)I$$
with $\sigma_0$ as yield stress. If there is no plastic deformation - that is $\lambda=0$ - this yields $\vert\sigma^D\vert < \sigma_0$
and otherwise if $\lambda > 0$ it follows that $\vert\sigma^D\vert = \sigma_0$.
That means if the stress is smaller than the yield stress there are only elastic
deformations. Or to consider it the other way around. If the deviator stress is
in a norm bigger or equal than the yield stress there are plastic deformations
and $\lambda$ would be positiv.\\
There the index $D$ denotes the deviator part of for example the stress where
$tr(.)$ is the trace of a tensor. The definition shows an additive decomposition
of the stress $\sigma$ into a hydrostatic part (or volumetric part) $\dfrac{1}{3}tr(\tau)I$ and the deviator
part $\sigma^D$. For metal the deviator stress composes the main indicator for
plastic deformations.\\
The third equation is called equilibrium condition with a force of volume
density $f$ which we will neglect in our example.
The boundary of $\Omega$ separates as follows $\Gamma=\Gamma_D\bigcup\Gamma_C$ and $\Gamma_D\bigcap\Gamma_C=\emptyset$.
At the boundary $\Gamma_D$ we have zero Dirichlet conditions. $\Gamma_C$ denotes the potential contact boundary.\\
The last two lines decribe the so-called Signorini contact conditions. If there is no contact the normal  stress
$$ \sigma_n =  \sigma n\cdot n$$
is zero with the outward normal $n$. If there is contact ($u_n = g$) the tangential stress $\sigma_t = \sigma\cdot n - \sigma_n n$
vanishes, because we consider a frictionless situation and the normal stress is
negative. The gap $g$ comes with the start configuration of the obstacle and the
deformable body.

\section{Derivation of the variational inequality}

As a starting point we want to minimise an energy functional:
$$E(\tau) := \dfrac{1}{2}\int\limits_{\Omega}\tau A \tau d\tau,\quad \tau\in \Pi W^{div}$$
with
$$W^{div}:=\lbrace \tau\in
L^2(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{dim\times\dim}_{sym}):div(\tau)\in L^2(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{dim})\rbrace$$ and
$$\Pi \Sigma:=\lbrace \tau\in \Sigma, \mathcal{F}(\tau)\leq 0\rbrace$$
as the set of admissible stresses which is defined
by a continious, convex flow function $\mathcal{F}$.

With the goal to derive the dual formulation of the minimisation problem, we define a lagrange function:
$$L(\tau,\varphi) := E(\tau) + (\varphi, div(\tau)),\quad \lbrace\tau,\varphi\rbrace\in\Pi W^{div}\times V^+$$
with
$$V^+ := \lbrace u\in V: u_n\leq g \text{ on } \Gamma_C \rbrace$$
$$V:=\left[ H_0^1 \right]^{dim}:=\lbrace u\in \left[H^1(\Omega)\right]^{dim}: u
= 0 \text{ on } \Gamma_D\rbrace$$
By building the fr\'echet derivatives of $L$ for both components we obtain the dual formulation for the stationary case
which is known as \textbf{Hencky-Type-Model}:\\
Find a pair $\lbrace\sigma,u\rbrace\in \Pi W\times V^+$ with
$$\left(A\sigma,\tau - \sigma\right) + \left(u, div(\tau) - div(\sigma)\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \tau\in \Pi W^{div}$$
$$-\left(div(\sigma),\varphi - u\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \varphi\in V^+.$$
By integrating by parts and multiplying the first inequality by $C=A^{-1}$  we achieve the primal-mixed version of our problem:\\
Find a pair $\lbrace\sigma,u\rbrace\in \Pi W\times V^+$ with
$$\left(\sigma,\tau - \sigma\right) - \left(C\varepsilon(u), \tau - \sigma\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \tau\in \Pi W$$
$$\left(\sigma,\varepsilon(\varphi) - \varepsilon(u)\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \varphi\in V^+.$$
Therein $\varepsilon$ denotes the linearised deformation tensor with $\varepsilon(u) := \dfrac{1}{2}\left(\nabla u + \nabla u^T\right)$ for small deformations.\\
Most materials - especially metals - have the property that they show some hardening effects during the forming process.
There are different constitutive laws to describe those material behavior. The most simple one is called linear isotropic hardening
with the flow function $\mathcal{F}(\tau,\eta) = \vert\tau^D\vert - (\sigma_0 + \gamma\eta)$.
It can be considered by establishing an additional term in our primal-mixed formulation:\\
Find a pair $\lbrace(\sigma,\xi),u\rbrace\in \Pi (W\times L^2(\Omega,\mathbb{R}))\times V^+$ with
$$\left(\sigma,\tau - \sigma\right) - \left(C\varepsilon(u), \tau - \sigma\right) + \gamma\left( \xi, \eta - \xi\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall (\tau,\eta)\in \Pi (W,L^2(\Omega,\mathbb{R}))$$
$$\left(\sigma,\varepsilon(\varphi) - \varepsilon(u)\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \varphi\in V^+,$$
with the hardening parameter $\gamma > 0$.\\
Now we want to derive a primal problem which only depends on the displacement $u$. For that purpose we
set $\eta = \xi$ and eliminate the stress $\sigma$ by applying the projection theorem on\\
$$\left(\sigma - C\varepsilon(u), \tau - \sigma\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \tau\in \Pi W,$$
which yields with the second inequality:\\
Find the displacement $u\in V^+$ with
$$\left(P_{\Pi}(C\varepsilon(u)),\varepsilon(\varphi) - \varepsilon(u)\right) \geq 0,\quad \forall \varphi\in V^+,$$
with the projection:
$$P_{\Pi}(\tau):=\begin{cases}
			\tau, & \text{if }\vert\tau^D\vert \leq \sigma_0 +  \gamma\xi,\\
			\hat\alpha\dfrac{\tau^D}{\vert\tau^D\vert} + \dfrac{1}{3}tr(\tau), & \text{if }\vert\tau^D\vert > \sigma_0 +  \gamma\xi,
			\end{cases}$$
with the radius
$$\hat\alpha := \sigma_0 + \gamma\xi .$$
With the relation $\xi = \vert\varepsilon(u) - A\sigma\vert$ it is possible to eliminate $\xi$ inside the projection $P_{\Pi}$:\\
$$P_{\Pi}(\tau):=\begin{cases}
			\tau, & \text{if }\vert\tau^D\vert \leq \sigma_0,\\
			\alpha\dfrac{\tau^D}{\vert\tau^D\vert} + \dfrac{1}{3}tr(\tau), & \text{if }\vert\tau^D\vert > \sigma_0,
			\end{cases}$$
$$\alpha := \sigma_0 + \dfrac{\gamma}{2\mu+\gamma}\left(\vert\tau^D\vert - \sigma_0\right) ,$$
with a further material parameter $\mu>0$ called shear modulus.\\
So what we do is to calculate the stresses by using Hooke's law for linear elastic,  isotropic materials
$$\sigma = C \varepsilon(u) = 2\mu \varepsilon^D(u) + \kappa tr(\varepsilon(u))I = \left[2\mu\left(\mathbb{I} -\dfrac{1}{3} I\otimes I\right) + \kappa I\otimes I\right]\varepsilon(u)$$
with the material parameter $\kappa>0$ (bulk modulus). The variables $I$ and $\mathbb{I}$ denote the identity tensors of second and forth order.\\
In the next step we test in a pointwise sense where the deviator part of the stress in a norm is bigger as the yield stress.
If there are such points we project the deviator stress in those points back to the yield surface. Methods of this kind
are called projections algorithm or radial-return-algorithm.\\
Now we have a primal formulation of our elasto-plastic contact problem which only depends on the displacement $u$.
It consists of a nonlinear variational inequality and has a unique solution as it shows the theorem of Lions and Stampaccia
(A proof can be found in Rodrigues: Obstacle Problems in Mathematical Physics, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1987).\\
To handle the nonlinearity of the constitutive law we use a Newton method and to deal with the contact we apply an
active set method like in step-41. To be more concrete we combine both methods to an inexact semi smooth Newton
method - inexact since we use an iterative solver for the linearised problems in each Newton step.

\section{Linearisation of the constitutive law for the Newton method}

For the Newton method we have to linearise the following semi-linearform
$$a(\psi;\varphi) := \left(P_{\Pi}(C\varepsilon(\varphi)),\varepsilon(\varphi)\right).$$
Becaus we have to find the solution $u$ in the convex set $V^+$, we have to apply an SQP-method (SQP: sequential quadratic
programming). That means we have to solve a minimisation problem for a known $u^i$ in every SQP-step of the form
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & & a(u^{i};u^{i+1} - u^i) + \dfrac{1}{2}a'(u^i;u^{i+1} - u^i,u^{i+1} - u^i)\\
 &=&  a(u^i;u^{i+1}) -  a(u^i;u^i) +\\
 & & \dfrac{1}{2}\left( a'(u^i;u^{i+1},u^{i+1}) - 2a'(u^i;u^i,u^{i+1}) - a'(u^i;u^i,u^i)\right)\\
 &\rightarrow& min,\quad u^{i+1}\in V^+.
\end{eqnarray*}
Neglecting the constant terms $ a(u^i;u^i)$ and $ a'(u^i;u^i,u^i)$ we obtain the following minimisation problem
$$\dfrac{1}{2} a'(u^i;u^{i+1},u^{i+1}) - F(u^i)\rightarrow min,\quad u^{i+1}\in V^+$$
with
$$F(\varphi) := \left(a'(\varphi;\varphi,u^{i+1}) -  a(\varphi;u^{i+1}) \right).$$
In the case of our constitutive law the derivative of the semi-linearform $a(.;.)$ at the point $u^i$ is

$$a'(u^i;\psi,\varphi) =$$
$$
\begin{cases}
\left(\left[2\mu\left(\mathbb{I}  - \dfrac{1}{3} I\otimes I\right) + \kappa I\otimes I\right]\varepsilon(\psi),\varepsilon(\varphi)\right), & \quad
      \vert \tau^D \vert \leq \sigma_0\\
\left(\left[\dfrac{\alpha}{\vert\tau^D\vert}2\mu\left(\mathbb{I}  - \dfrac{1}{3} I\otimes I - \dfrac{\tau^D\otimes\tau^D}{\vert\tau^D\vert}\right) +
      \kappa I\otimes I\right]\varepsilon(\psi),\varepsilon(\varphi) \right), &
 \quad \vert \tau^D \vert > \sigma_0
\end{cases}
$$
with
$$\tau^D :=  C\varepsilon^D(u^i).$$
Again the first case is for elastic and the second for plastic deformation.

\section{Formulation as a saddle point problem}

On the line of step-41 we compose a saddle point problem out of the minimisation problem. Again we do so to gain a formulation
that allows us to solve a linear system of equations finally.\\
We introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ and the convex cone $K\subset W'$,
$W'$ dual space of the trace space $W$ of $V$ restricted to $\Gamma_C$,
$$K:=\{\mu\in W':\mu_T = 0,\quad\langle\mu n,v\rangle_{\Gamma_C}\geq 0,\quad
\forall v\in W, v \ge 0\text{ on }\Gamma_C \}$$
of Lagrange multipliers, where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$
denotes the duality pairing between $W'$ and $W$. Intuitively, $K$ is the cone
of all "non-positive functions", except that $ K\subset
\left( \left[ H_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \right]^{dim} \right)' $ and so contains other
objects besides regular functions as well. This yields:\\

\noindent
\textit{Find $u\in V$ and $\lambda\in K$ such that}
\begin{align*}
 \hat{a}(u,v) + b(v,\lambda) &= f(v),\quad &&v\in V\\
 b(u,\mu - \lambda) &\leq \langle g,(\mu -
 \lambda)n\rangle_{\Gamma_C},\quad&&\mu\in K,
\end{align*}
\textit{with}
\begin{align*}
 \hat{a}(u,v) &:= a'(u^i;u,v)\\
 b(u,\mu) &:= \langle un,\mu n\rangle_{\Gamma_C},\quad &&u\in V,\quad\mu\in W'.
\end{align*}
As in the section before $u^i$ denotes the linearization point for the
semi-linearform $a(.;.)$. In contrast to step-41 we directly consider $\lambda$
as the additional, positive force $\sigma(u)n$ that the obstacle
exerts on the boundary $\Gamma_C$ of the body.\\

\noindent
The existence and uniqueness of the analytical solution $(u,\lambda)\in V\times
K$ of this saddle point problem has been stated in Glowinski, Lions and Tr\'{e}moli\`{e}res: Numerical
Analysis of Variational Inequalities, North-Holland, 1981.\\

\noindent
NOTE: In this example as well as in the further documentation we make the
assumption that the normal vector $n$ equals to $(0,0,1)$. This comes up with
the starting condition of our deformable body.

\section{Active Set methods to solve the saddle point problem}

The linearized problem is essentially like a pure elastic problem with contact like
in step-41. The only difference consists in the fact that the contact area
adjudges at the boundary instead of in the domain. But this has no further consequence
so that we refer to the documentation of step-41 with the only hint that
$\mathcal{S}$ containts all the vertices at the contact boundary $\Gamma_C$ this
time.

\section{The primal-dual active set algorithm combined with the inexact semi smooth
Newton method}

Now we describe an algorithm that combines the Newton-method, which we use for
the nonlinear constitutive law, with the semismooth Newton method for the contact. It
sums up the results of the sections before and works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(0)] Initialize $\mathcal{A}_k$ and $\mathcal{F}_k$, such that $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{A}_k \cup \mathcal{F}_k$ and $\mathcal{A}_k \cap \mathcal{F}_k = \emptyset$ and set $k = 1$.
 \item[(1)] Assemble the Newton matrix $a'(U^k;\varphi_i,\varphi_j)$ and the right-hand-side $F(U^k)$.
 \item[(2)] Find the primal-dual pair $(U^k,\Lambda^k)$ that satisfies
 \begin{align*}
 AU^k + B\Lambda^k & = F, &\\
 \left[BU^k\right]_i & = G & & \forall i\in\mathcal{A}_k\\
 \Lambda^k_i & = 0 & & \forall i\in\mathcal{F}_k.
 \end{align*}
% Note that $\mathcal{S}$ contains only dofs related to the boundary $\Gamma_C$. So in contrast to step-41 there are much more than $\vert \mathcal{S}\vert$ equations necessary to determine $U$ and $\Lambda$.
 \item[(3)] Define the new active and inactive sets by
 $$\mathcal{A}_{k+1}:=\lbrace i\in\mathcal{S}:\Lambda^k_i +
 c\left(\left[BU^k\right]_i - G_i\right) > 0\rbrace,$$
 $$\mathcal{F}_{k+1}:=\lbrace i\in\mathcal{S}:\Lambda^k_i +
 c\left(\left[BU^k\right]_i - G_i\right) \leq 0\rbrace.$$
 \item[(4)] If $\mathcal{A}_{k+1} = \mathcal{A}_k$ and $\vert
 F\left(U^{k+1}\right) \vert < \delta$ then stop, else set $k=k+1$ and go to
 step (1).
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Compare to step-41 step (1) is added but it should be clear from the sections
above that we only linearize the problem. In step (2) we have to solve a linear
system of equations again. And now the solution has to fulfill two stopping criterias. $\mathcal{A}_{k+1} = \mathcal{A}_k$ makes sure that the contact zones
are iterated and the second ensures an accurate enough residual which means that
the plastic zones are also iterated.
