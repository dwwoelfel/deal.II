				 // This one is new. We want to read a
				 // triangulation from disk, and the
				 // class which does this is declared
				 // in the following file:
#include <grid/grid_in.h>

				 // We will use a circular domain, and
				 // the object describing the boundary
				 // of it comes from this file:
#include <grid/tria_boundary_lib.h>

				 // This is C++ ...
#include <fstream>
				 // ... and this is too: We will
				 // convert integers to strings using
				 // the C++ stringstream class
				 // ``ostringstream''. One annoying
				 // complication arises here in that
				 // the classes ``std::istringstream''
				 // and ``std::ostringstream'' (with
				 // these names) have not been part of
				 // standard libraries of C++
				 // compilers for long. They have only
				 // been part of C++ compilers since
				 // around the time the C++ standard
				 // was made in 1999. For example, the
				 // gcc compiler up to and including
				 // version 2.95.2 did not have them,
				 // but instead provided classes
				 // ``istrstream'' and ``ostrstream''
				 // with a similar, but nevertheless
				 // slightly different
				 // interface. Furthermore, they were
				 // declared in the include file
				 // ``<strstream>'', while the new
				 // standards conforming classes are
				 // declared in ``<sstream>''. Many
				 // other compilers followed the gcc
				 // scheme, so whenever we want to
				 // support versions of compilers that
				 // appeared before approximately
				 // 2000/2001, we have to support
				 // these old classes.
				 //
				 // Since we do want to support these
				 // compilers, the ``./configure''
				 // script you run as the very first
				 // step of installing the library
				 // determines whether the compiler
				 // you want to use supports the new
				 // classes, or whether we have to
				 // fall back on the old ones. If the
				 // new classes are supported, then
				 // the preprocessor variable
				 // ``HAVE_STD_STRINGSTREAM'' is set
				 // in the ``base/config.h'' include
				 // file, that all include files in
				 // the library also include. Since we
				 // have included quite a number of
				 // files from the library at this
				 // point, the definition or
				 // non-definition of this
				 // preprocessor variable can now be
				 // used to decide whether old or new
				 // header names have to be used to
				 // import string stream classes:
#ifdef HAVE_STD_STRINGSTREAM
#  include <sstream>
#else
#  include <strstream>
#endif


				 // The main class is mostly as in the
				 // previous example. The most visible
				 // change is that the function
				 // ``make_grid_and_dofs'' has been
				 // removed, since making of the grid
				 // is now done in the ``run''
				 // function and the rest of its
				 // functionality now is in
				 // ``setup_system''. Apart from this,
				 // everything is as before.

				   // of programming errors are

				   // as invalid array sizes, etc, so
				   // we should try to make sure that
				   // the parameters are valid. For
				   // this, the Assert macro is a good
				   // means, since it asserts that the
				   // condition which is given as
				   // first argument is valid, and if
				   // not throws an exception (its
				   // second argument) which will
				   // usually terminate the program
				   // giving information where the
				   // error occured and what the
				   // reason was. This generally
				   // reduces the time to find
				   // programming errors dramatically
				   // and we have found assertions an
				   // invaluable means to program
				   // fast.
				   //
				   // On the other hand, all these
				   // checks (there are more than 2000
				   // of them in the library) should
				   // not slow down the program too
				   // much, which is why the Assert
				   // macro is only used in debug mode
				   // and expands to nothing if in
				   // optimized mode. Therefore, while
				   // you test your program and debug
				   // it, the assertions will tell you
				   // where the problems are, and once
				   // your program is stable you can
				   // switch off debugging and the
				   // program will run without the
				   // assertions and at maximum speed.
				   //
				   // Here, as has been said above, we
				   // would like to make sure that the
				   // size of the two arrays is equal,
				   // and if not throw an
				   // exception. Since the following
				   // test is rather frequent for the
				   // classes derived from
				   // ``Function'', that class
				   // declares an exception
				   // ``ExcDimensionMismatch'' which
				   // takes the sizes of two vectors
				   // and prints some output in case
				   // the condition is violated:
  Assert (values.size() == n_points, 
	  ExcDimensionMismatch (values.size(), n_points));
				   // Since examples are not very good
				   // if they do not demonstrate their
				   // point, we will show how to
				   // trigger this exception at the
				   // end of the main program, and
				   // what output results from this
				   // (see the ``Results'' section of
				   // this example program). You will
				   // certainly notice that the output
				   // is quite well suited to quickly
				   // find what the problem is and
				   // what parameters are expected. An
				   // additional plus is that if the
				   // program is run inside a
				   // debugger, it will stop at the
				   // point where the exception is
				   // triggered, so you can go up the
				   // call stack to immediately find
				   // the place where the the array
				   // with the wrong size was set up.
  
				   // While we're at it, we can do
				   // another check: the coefficient
				   // is a scalar, but the Function
				   // class also represents
				   // vector-valued function. A scalar
				   // function must therefore be
				   // considered as a vector-valued
				   // function with only one
				   // component, so the only valid
				   // component for which a user might
				   // ask is zero (we always count
				   // from zero). The following
				   // assertion checks this. (The

				   // has.)

				   // default values, so we only have
				   // to change those that we don't

				   // to scale the z-axis differently
				   // (stretch each data point in
				   // z-direction by a factor of four):
  eps_flags.z_scaling = 4;
				   // Then we would also like to alter
				   // the viewpoint from which we look
				   // at the solution surface. The
				   // default is at an angle of 60
				   // degrees down from the vertical
				   // axis, and 30 degrees rotated
				   // against it in mathematical
				   // positive sense. We raise our
				   // viewpoint a bit and look more
				   // along the y-axis:
  eps_flags.azimut_angle = 40;
  eps_flags.turn_angle   = 10;
				   // That shall suffice. There are
				   // more flags, for example whether
				   // to draw the mesh lines, which
				   // data vectors to use for
				   // colorization of the interior of
				   // the cells, and so on. You may
				   // want to take a look at the
				   // documentation of the EpsFlags
				   // structure to get an overview of
				   // what is possible.
				   //
				   // The only thing still to be done,
				   // is to tell the output object to
				   // use these flags:
  data_out.set_flags (eps_flags);
				   // The above way to modify flags
				   // requires recompilation each time
				   // we would like to use different
				   // flags. This is inconvenient, and
				   // we will see more advanced ways
				   // in following examples where the
				   // output flags are determined at
				   // run time using an input file.

				   // Finally, we need the filename to
				   // which the results are to be
				   // written. We would like to have
				   // it of the form
				   // ``solution-N.eps'', where N is
				   // the number of the refinement
				   // cycle. Thus, we have to convert
				   // an integer to a part of a
				   // string; this can be done using
				   // the ``sprintf'' function, but in
				   // C++ there is a more elegant way:
				   // write everything into a special
				   // stream (just like writing into a
				   // file or to the screen) and
				   // retrieve what you wrote as a
				   // string. This applies the usual
				   // conversions from integer to
				   // strings, and one could as well
				   // give stream modifiers such as
				   // ``setw'', ``setprecision'', and
				   // so on.
				   //
				   // In C++, you can do this by using
				   // the so-called stringstream
				   // classes. As already discussed at
				   // the point of inclusion of the
				   // respective header file above,
				   // there is some historical
				   // confusion we have to work around
				   // here, since the class we'd like
				   // to use used to be called
				   // ``ostrstream'', but now is named
				   // ``ostringstream''. In the same
				   // way as done above in deciding
				   // which file to include, we here
				   // decide which class name to use:
#ifdef HAVE_STD_STRINGSTREAM
  std::ostringstream filename;
#else
  std::ostrstream filename;
#endif
				   // Fortunately, the interface of
				   // the two classes which we might
				   // now be using, depending on which
				   // one is available, is close
				   // enough that we need to take care
				   // about the differences only once
				   // below, so we can use them in a
				   // rather straightforward way, even
				   // if they are not identical.

				   // In order to now actually
				   // generate a filename, we fill the
				   // stringstream variable with the
				   // base of the filename, then the
				   // number part, and finally the
				   // suffix indicating the file type:
  filename << "solution-"
	   << cycle
	   << ".eps";
  
				   // For the old string stream
				   // classes, we have to append the
				   // final '\0' that appears at the
				   // end of ``char *''
				   // variables. This is done by the
				   // following construct:
#ifndef HAVE_STD_STRINGSTREAM
  filename << std::ends;
#endif
				   // We can get whatever we wrote to
				   // the stream using the ``str()''
				   // function. If the new
				   // stringstream classes are used,
				   // then the result is a string
				   // which we have to convert to a
				   // char* using the ``c_str()''
				   // function, otherwise the result
				   // is a char* right away. Use that
				   // as filename for the output
				   // stream:
#ifdef HAVE_STD_STRINGSTREAM
  std::ofstream output (filename.str().c_str());
#else
  std::ofstream output (filename.str());
#endif
				   // And then write the data to the
				   // file.
  data_out.write_eps (output);
