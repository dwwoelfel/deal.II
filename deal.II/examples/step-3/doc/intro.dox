<h1>Introduction</h1>


This is the first example where we actually use finite elements to compute
something. We 
will solve a simple version of Poisson's equation with zero boundary
values, but a nonzero right hand side (here equal to the constant one).
This example shows the basic structure of most finite
element programs, which are along the following lines:
<ul>
  <li> Grid generation;
  <li> Assembling matrices and vectors of the discrete system;
  <li> Solving the linear system of equations;
  <li> Writing results to disk.
</ul>
