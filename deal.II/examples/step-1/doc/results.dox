The program has, after having been run, produced two grids, which look
like this:

<TABLE WIDTH="60%" ALIGN="center">
  <tr>
    <td ALIGN="center">
      @image html step-1.grid-1.png
    </td>

    <td ALIGN="center">
      @image html step-1.grid-2.png
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The left one, well, is not very exciting. The right one is &mdash; at least
&mdash; unconventional.
