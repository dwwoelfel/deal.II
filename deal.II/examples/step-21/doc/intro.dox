<a name="Intro"></a> <h1>Introduction</h1>

This program grew out of a student project by Yan Li at Texas A&amp;M
University. Most of the work for this program is by her.

In this project, we propose a numerical simulation for two phase
flow problems in porous media. This problem includes one
elliptic equation and one nonlinear, time dependent transport
equation. This is therefore also the first time-dependent tutorial
program (besides the somewhat strange time-dependence of step-18). 


<h2>The two phase flow problem</h2>

Modeling of two phase flow in porous media is important for both
environmental remediation and the management of petroleum
reservoirs. Practical situations involving two phase flow include the
dispersal of a nonaqueous phase liquid in an aquifer, or the joint
movement of a mixture of fluids such as oil and water in a
reservoir. Simulation models, if they are to provide realistic
predictions, must accurately account for these effects.

To derive the governing equations, consider two phase flow in a
reservoir $\Omega$ under the assumption that the movement of fluids is
dominated by viscous effects; i.e. we neglect the effects of gravity,
compressibility, and capillary pressure. Porosity will be considered
to be constant. We will denote variables refering to either of the two
phases using subscripts $w$ and $o$, short for water and oil. The
derivation of the equations holds for other pairs of fluids as well,
however. 

The velocity with which molecules of each of the two phases move is
determined by Darcy's law that states that the velocity is
proportional to the pressure gradient:
@f{eqnarray*}
  \mathbf{u}_{j} 
  = 
  -\frac{k_{rj}(S)}{\mu_{j}} \mathbf{K} \cdot \nabla p 
@f}
where $\mathbf{u}_{j}$ is the velocity of phase $j=o,w$, $K$ is the
permeability tensor, $k_{rj}$ is the relative permeability of phase
$j$, $p$ is the
pressure and $\mu_{j}$ is the viscosity of phase $j$. Finally, $S$ is
the saturation (volume fraction), i.e. a function with values between
0 and 1 indicating the composition of the mixture of fluids. In
general, the coefficients $K, k_{rj}, \mu$ may be spatially dependent
variables, and we will always treat them as non-constant functions in
the following.

We combine Darcy's law with the statement of conservation of mass for
each phase,
@f[
  \textrm{div}\ \mathbf{u}_{j} = q_j,
@f]
with a source term for each phase. By summing over the two phases, 
we can express the governing equations in terms of the
so-called pressure equation:
@f{eqnarray*}
- \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{K}\lambda(S) \nabla p)= q.
@f}
Here, $q$ is th sum source term, and
@f[
  \lambda(S) = \frac{k_{rw}(S)}{\mu_{w}}+\frac{k_{ro}(S)}{\mu_{o}}
@f]
is the total mobility.

So far, this looks like an ordinary stationary, Poisson-like equation
that we can solve right away with the techniques of the first few
tutorial programs (take a look at step-6, for example, for something
very similar). However, we have not said anything yet about the
saturation, which of course is going to change as the fluids move around.

The second part of the equations is a therefore description of the
dynamics of the saturation. We model this as an advected quantity:
@f{eqnarray*}
  S_{t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla F(S) = 0.
@f}
where $\mathbf u$ is the total velocity
@f[
  \mathbf{u} =
  \mathbf{u}_{o} + \mathbf{u}_{w} = -\lambda(S) \mathbf{K}\cdot\nabla p.
@f]
In addition, 
@f[
  F(S) 
  = 
  \frac{k_{rw}(S)/\mu_{w}}{k_{rw}(S)/\mu_{w} + k_{ro}(S)/\mu_{o}}
@f]
Note that the advection equation contains the term $\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla
F(S)$ rather than $\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla S$ to indicate that the saturation
is not simply transported along; rather, since the two phases move with
different velocities, the saturation can actually change even in the advected
coordinate system.

In summary, what we get are the following two equations:
@f{eqnarray*}
  - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{K}\lambda(S) \nabla p) &=& q
  \qquad \textrm{in}\ \Omega\times[0,T],
  \\
  S_{t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla F(S) &=& 0
  \qquad \textrm{in}\ \Omega\times[0,T].
@f}
Here, $p=p(\mathbf x, t), S=S(\mathbf x, t)$ are now time dependent
functions: while at every time instant the flow field is in
equilibrium with the pressure (i.e. we neglect dynamic
accellerations), the saturation is transported along with the flow and
therefore changes over time, in turn affected the flow field again
through the dependence of the first equation on $S$.

This set of equations has a peculiar character: one of the two
equations has a time derivative, the other one doesn't. This
corresponds to the character that the pressure and velocities are
coupled through an instantaneous constraint, whereas the saturation
evolves over finite time scales.

Such systems of equations are called Differential Algebraic Equations
(DAEs), since one of the equations is a differential equation, the
other is not (at least not with respect to the time variable) and is
therefore an "algebraic" equation. (The notation comes from the field
of ordinary differential equations, where everything that does not
have derivatives with respect to the time variable is necessarily an
algebraic equation.) This class of equations contains pretty
well-known cases: for example, the time dependent Stokes and
Navier-Stokes equations (where the algebraic constraint is that the
divergence of the flow field, $\textrm{div}\ \mathbf u$, must be zero)
as well as the time dependent Maxwell equations (here, the algebraic
constraint is that the divergence of the electric displacement field
equals the charge density, $\textrm{div}\ \mathbf D = \rho$ and that the
divergence of the magnetic flux density is zero: $\textrm{div}\ \mathbf
B = 0$). We will see that the different character of the two equations
will inform our discretization strategy for the two equations.


<h2>Time discretization</h2>

In the reservoir simulation community, it is common to solve the equations
derived above by going back to the first order, mixed formulation. To this
end, we re-introduce the total velocity $\mathbf u$ and write the equations in
the following form:
\f{eqnarray*}
  \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{K}\lambda(S) \nabla p&=&0 \\
  \nabla \cdot\mathbf{u} &=& 0 \\
  S_{t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla F(S) &=& 0.
\f}
This formulation has the additional benefit that we do not have to express the
total velocity $\mathbf u$ appearing in the transport equation as a function
of the pressure, but can rather take the primary variable for it. Given the
saddle point structure of the first two equations and their similarity to the
mixed Laplace formulation we have introduced in step-20, it will come as no
surprise that we will use a mixed discretization again. 

But let's postpone this for a moment. The first business we have with these
equations is to think about the time discretization. In reservoir simulation,
there is a rather standard algorithm that we will use here. It first solves
the pressure using an implicit equation, then the saturation using an explicit
time stepping scheme. The algorithm is called IMPES for IMplicit Pressure
Explicit Saturation. In a slightly modified form, this algorithm can be
written as follows: for each time step, solve
\f{eqnarray*}
  \mathbf{u}^{n+1}+\mathbf{K}\lambda(S^n) \nabla p^{n+1}&=&0 \\
  \nabla \cdot\mathbf{u}^{n+1} &=& 0 \\
  \frac {S^{n+1}-S^n}{\triangle t} + \mathbf{u}^{n+1} \cdot \nabla F(S^n) &=& 0,
\f}
where $\triangle t$ is the length of a time step. Note how we solve the
implicit pressure-velocity system that only depends on the previously computed
saturation $S^n$, and then do an explicit time step for $S^{n+1}$ that only
depends on the previously known $S^n$ and the just computed $\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$.

We can then state the problem in weak form as follows, by multiplying each
equation with test functions $\mathbf v$, $q$, and $\sigma$ and integrating
terms on each cell $K$ by parts:
\f{eqnarray*}
  \sum_K
  \left((\mathbf{K}\lambda(S^n))^{-1} \mathbf{u}^{n+1},\mathbf v\right)_K -
  (p^{n+1}, \mathbf v)_K &=& 
  - (p^{n+1}, \mathbf v)_{\partial\Omega} 
  \\
  (\nabla \cdot\mathbf{u}^{n+1}, q)_\Omega &=& 0 
\f}
Note that in the first term, we have to prescribe the pressure $p^{n+1}$ on
the boundary $\partial\Omega$ as boundary values for our problem. $\mathbf n$
denotes the unit outward normal vector to $\partial K$, as usual.

For the saturation equation, we obtain
\f{eqnarray*}
  (S^{n+1}, \sigma)_\Omega
  +
  \triangle t 
  \sum_K
  \left\{
  \left(F(S^n), \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}^{n+1} \sigma)\right)_K
  -
  \left(F(S^n) (\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}, \sigma\right)_{\partial K}
  \right\}
  &=&
  (S^n,\sigma)_\Omega.
\f}
Using the fact that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}=0$, we can rewrite the cell
term to get an equation as follows:
\f{eqnarray*}
  (S^{n+1}, \sigma)_\Omega
  +
  \triangle t 
  \sum_K
  \left\{
  \left(F(S^n) \mathbf{u}^{n+1}, \nabla \sigma)\right)_K
  -
  \left(F(S^n) (\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}), \sigma\right)_{\partial K}
  \right\}
  &=&
  (S^n,\sigma)_\Omega.
\f}



<h2>Space discretization</h2>

In each time step, we then apply the mixed finite method of step-20 to the
velocity and pressure. To be well-posed, we choose Raviart-Thomas spaces
$RT_{k}$ for $\mathbf{u}$ and discontinuous elements of class $DQ_{k}$ for
$p$. For the saturation, we will also choose $DQ_{k}$ spaces.

Since we have discontinuous spaces, we have to think about how to evaluate
terms on the interfaces between cells, since discontinuous functions are not
really defined there. In particular, we have to give a meaning to the last
term on the left hand side of the saturation equation. To this end, let us
define that we want to evaluate it in the following sense:
@f{eqnarray*}
  &&\left(F(S^n) (\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}), \sigma\right)_{\partial K}
  \\
  &&\qquad =
  \left(F(S^n_+) (\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}_+), \sigma\right)_{\partial K_+}
  +
  \left(F(S^n_-) (\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf{u}^{n+1}_-), \sigma\right)_{\partial K_-},
@f}
where $\partial K_{-}:= \{x\in \partial K, \mathbf{u}(x) \cdot \mathbf{n}<0\}$
denotes the inflow boundary and $\partial K_{+}:= \{\partial K \setminus
\partial K_{-}\}$ is the outflow part of the boundary.
The quantities $S_+,\mathbf{u}_+$ then correspond to the values of these
variables on the present cell, whereas $S_-,\mathbf{u}_-$ (needed on the
inflow part of the boundary of $K$) are quantities taken from the neighboring
cell. Some more context on discontinuous element techniques and evaluation of
fluxes can also be found in step-12.


<h2>Linear solvers</h2>

The linear solvers used in this program are a straightforward extension of the
ones used in step-20. Essentially, we simply have to extend everything from
two to three solution components.

 $(1)$ We has the three blocks vector $(u,p,S)$ , in which
all the functions are dependent on time. i.e. At each time step we
need project the $solution$ into $old-solution$, using
$old-solution$ to get a new $solution$.
Keep doing this until the last time step;

At time $t=t^{n+1}$ , suppose $old-solution=(u^{n},p^{n},S^{n})$ is
known, in $assemble-system()$ part, we assemble system matrix as:
\f[
\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
\lceil &M(S^{n}) &B^{T}& 0 &\rceil & \lceil& \mathbf{u}^{n+1}&\rceil& &\lceil& 0 &\rceil\\
|      &B&    0 & 0 & |     &|      & p^{n+1} &|        &=&|     & q &|\\
\lfloor&\triangle t \nabla F(S^n)&    0& I & \rfloor & \lfloor
&S^{n+1} & \rfloor & & \lfloor& S^{n}& \rfloor
\end{array}
\f]

In $solve()$ part, we solve the first two equations independent of
the third equation, since $M( S^n)$ is already known. As in step-20,
using vector base functions, Schur complement with a
preconditioner and CG method, we get $u^{n+1}$and $p^{n+1}$.

Then, with the above $u^{n+1}$ and $p^{n+1}$, we could compute
$S^{n+1}$ by :
@f{eqnarray*}
\sum_{\kappa}\int_{\kappa}S^{n+1} \phi dx&&=
\sum_{\kappa}\{\int_{\kappa} S^{n} \phi dx+\Delta t\int_{\kappa}
F(S^{n}) \mathbf{u^{n+1}}\cdot \nabla \phi dx\\
\nonumber && -\Delta t \int_{\partial \kappa_{-}}F(S^{n,-})
\mathbf{u}^{n+1,-}\cdot \mathbf{n} \phi dx -\Delta t \int_{\partial
\kappa_{+}}F(S^{n}) \mathbf{u}^{n+1}\cdot \mathbf{n} \phi dx\}
@f}
Now, project solution $(u^{n+1},p^{n+1},S^{n+1})$ into
$old-solution$, do the above process for next time step.

 
$(2)$ The numerical flux term is related with neighbor cells. In our
implementation $solve( )$, we do the following on each cell:

For each face, compute the flux $\mathbf{u}\cdot F(S)$, the flux is
negative means it is an in-flow face. Then if this in-flow face is
on the boundary $\Gamma_{1}$:$F(S^{-})=F(1)$; If the in-flow
face is not on boundary, $F(S^{-})=F(S|_{neighbor})$.
Flux is positive means it is an out-flow face, we just use $ F(S)$ on
current cell.

All the other functions are commented in code, please see next part
- the commented program.

<h2>Test Case</h2>

 For simplicity, in our project we will assume no
source $q=0$ and the heterogeneous porous medium is isotropic
$\mathbf{K}(x,y) =
k(x,y) \mathbf{I}$.

Our two dimensional numerical simulation will be done on unit cell
$\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]$ for $t\in [0,T]$.
 Boundary conditions are:
\f[
\begin{array}{cr}
p(x,y)=1 & \forall(x,y)\in \Gamma_{1}:=\{(x,y)\in \partial \Omega: x=0\}\\
p(x,y)=0 & \forall(x,y)\in  \Gamma_{2}:=\{(x,y)\in \partial \Omega: x=1\}\\
\mathbf{u}(x,y)\cdot \mathbf{n}=0 & \forall(x,y)\in
\partial\Omega \setminus(\Gamma_{1}\bigcup \Gamma_{2})
\end{array}
\f]

Initial conditions are:
\f[
\begin{array}{cr}
S(x,y,t=0)= 1& \forall (x,y) \in \Gamma_{1}\\
S(x,y,t=0) = 0 & \forall(x,y)\in \partial \Omega \setminus
\Gamma_{1}
\end{array}
\f]

Our two phase flow are chosen as water and oil. The total mobility
is : @f[\lambda (S) = \frac{1.0}{\mu} S^2 +(1-S)^2@f] Permeability is
:
@f[K(x,y)=\mathbf{k}(x,y)I=\frac{1.0}{2+1.99\sin(2\pi\frac{2x-y}{\epsilon})}
I@f]
 Fractional flow of water is: @f[F(S)=\frac{S^2}{S^2+\mu (1-S)^2}@f]
Choose $\epsilon=0.05$ , viscosity $\mu=0.2$.
The resulting solution will be shown in result part.
