=head1 NAME

KDOC -- Programmers' Documentation Extraction and Generation Tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	kdoc [-DqpieaP] [-f format] [-n libname] [-d outdir] [-u url] [-l lib]

	kdoc [--help]

	kdoc [--version]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

KDOC uses specially formatted comments in your C++ headers and CORBA IDL
files to create cross-referenced documentation in various formats. 

KDOC can also correctly handle "signal" and "slot" specifiers as used by the
Qt GUI Toolkit.

=head1 EXAMPLES

	kdoc -f html -d /home/web/komdoc -n kom *.idl
	kdoc -d /home/web/kdecore 
		-u "http://www.mydomain/kdecore/" 
		-n kdecore ~/kdelibs/kdecore/*.h -lqt

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--stdin>, B<-i>

Read the filenames to process from standard input. Ignored if
filenames are specified at the command line.

=item B<--format> <string>, B<-f> <string>

Generate output in the specific format. This can be used many times to
generate documentation in multiple formats. The default format is "html".

See the OUTPUT FORMAT OPTIONS section for a list of available formats.

=item B<--outputdir> <path>, B<-d> <path>

Write output in the specified path.

=item B<--url> <url>, B<-u> <url>

The URL which will be used for links when cross-referencing with this library.

=item B<--name> <string>, B<-n> <string>

Set the name of the library being processed, eg "kdecore"
If no name is set, no index file is produced.

=item B<--xref> <library>, B<-l> <library>

Cross-reference with the specified library. This will allow referencing
of classes etc that exist in the linked library. This option can be
specified multiple times.

For linking to work, you need to have generated documentation for the
linked library with kdoc, so that the necessary index file is produced.

=item B<--libdir> <path>, B<-L> <path>

Set the directory that will be used to store the index files generated
for cross-referencing. This is also used to search for index files for
xref. The default is $HOME/.kdoc.

=item B<--compress>, B<-z>

Compress generated KDOC index files with gzip to save space.

=item B<--private>, B<-p>

Document all private members. These are not documented by default.

=item B<--skip-internal>, B<-i>

Do not document internal members. They are documented as internal by default.

=item B<--skip-deprecated>, B<-e>

Do not document deprecated members. They are documented as deprecated by 
default.

=item B<--strip-h-path>

Strip the path from the filenames in the output.

=back

=head1 PREPROCESSOR OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--cpp>, B<-P>

Pass each source file through the C preprocessor. Currently g++
is required for this, but this requirement will change before
2.0. Directories for inclusion in the preprocessor header search path
can be specified via the B<-I> option.

=item B<--docincluded>

Parse files that are included by the preprocessor #include macro.
This is off by default.

=item B<-cppcmd> <command>, B<-C> <command>

Specify the preprocessor command that will be used. The default is:

	g++ -Wp,-C -E

All specified B<-I> paths will be appended to the command. This option
quietly enables the B<-P> option.

=item B<--includedir> <path>, B<-I> <path>

Add a directory to the preprocessor's header search paths. Requires the
B<-P> option. This option can be specified multiple times.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FORMAT OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<html>

Output documentation in HTML format. This is the default.

=item B<latex>

Output documentation as a LaTeX document. (unimplemented)

=item B<man>

Output documentation as man pages. (unimplemented)

=item B<texinfo>

Output documentation in texinfo format. You must set the library name
with the B<-n> option for the output to be generated.

=item B<docbook>

Output documentation in the DocBook SGML format. You must set the library
name with the B<-n> option for the output to be generated.

=item B<check>

Print a report about the documentation, eg undocumented classes
and functions.

=back

=head1 CROSS-REFERENCING LIBRARIES

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item B<*.kdoc>, B<*.kdoc.gz>

These are files that contain information about a library that has been
processed with kdoc. It is read for cross-referencing with other libraries
when the B<-l> option is used.

The B<.gz> extension signifies gzipped cross-reference files. kdoc is
capable of reading these, and generates them when the B<-z> option is used.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item B<KDOCLIBS>

If this is set, it is used as the default for the directory where generated
cross-reference index files are saved. See also the B<--libdir> option.
