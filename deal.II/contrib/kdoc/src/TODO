Bugs
----
Refs for external nodes are being double-escaped.

templates
	template functions
variables
	multivars cannot have values
	array initializers don't work
	pointers to functions
compound typedefs
functions
	Constructor initializers are appearing as part of the args.
	functions with funcptr or paren'd arguments
	operators are not properly quoted
	operators not always correctly parsed

Source for Forward decls should not be picked up.
Preprocessor screws up line numbers.

check "@params ... */"
check namespaces

HTML: links are screwed (multiple escapes somewhere).

If a member function is defined inline outside of the class, then it
is listed again in the class docs as a separate method; it is not
identified with the preexisting one, which was declared in the class.


General
-------
Running kdoc in-place
Major IDL cleanup

parser
------
documentation in source
CODE etc
templates

IDL specific: 
	parse "raises"

Doc specific
------------
	pre should be allowed inline.
	exceptions:
		@exception <exception>	Reason
		exception is a class

Ast
---
Allow cross-referencing between languages. I don't know how to do this,
other than by reading every language into the same syntax tree.

postprocessor
------------
referenced text use namespaces
	searchspaces:
		upward-searching (this and parents)
		enclosed (namespaces)

DocBook
-------
Don't use deref, we need a textref function instead.
	deref is for @refs etc.
visibility and flags in member docs.
Globals.
group indices.
Index.

HTML
----
Filenames - "/" being replaced by "#" is silly.
group indices.
cross-referenced headers

Libs
----
-L doesn't work properly (KDOCLIBS works ok).

Other
-----
Man
lxr
