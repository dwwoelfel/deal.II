Major:

* Get rid of the last bits of unguarded platform introspection

Some last bits and thoughts:

* Provide a configuration template for cross compiling with CMake,

* Support debug;optimized;general for all FEATURES

* document that we no longer need the two-lib installation of p4est

* same for the Mac part...
