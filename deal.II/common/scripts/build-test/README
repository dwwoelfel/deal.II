Build tests are organized such that they can be run individually
from a cron-job or by hand.


The standard setup is as follows:

1) Create a directory $DIR for the tests.
2) Copy $DEAL/contrib/config/config.guess and build-template there.
3) In $DIR, make modified copies of build-template
	for each of your tests. Make sure they are executable
4) Add a line to your crontab like

17 3 * * * (cd $DIR; build-XXX)

	where build-XXX is the modified version of build-template.
	This would start the build test each night at 3:17.
