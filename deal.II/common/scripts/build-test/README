Build tests are organized such that they can be run individually
from a cron-job or by hand.

I) Instructions for installing a new test

- Generate a config file ???.cfg in configurations
- Run 'make' in this directory
- Create a directory $DIR for the tests.
- Copy $DEAL/contrib/config/config.guess and build-??? there.
- Add a line to your crontab like

17 3 * * * (cd $DIR; /usr/local/bin/bash build-??? > /dev/null)

	where build-XXX is the modified version of build-template.
	This would start the build test each night at 3:17.



II) Instructions for writing configuration files

These files are perl scripts, operating on 'template'.

Refer to existing files for examples.
