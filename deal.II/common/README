Information about deal.II
=========================

1) Preliminaries:
=================
In order to use the deal.II library (and its sublibraries /base and
/lac) you need to have the following programs installed:
  - A fairly complete C++ compiler. We use egcs1.1.2 and gcc2.95 but
    other compilers might work as well. egcs1.0 will not work,
    however.
  - Perl: any Perl 5.x version should work.
  - Make: we use GNU make, version 3.75. We also use GNU make 3.78
    which has much better support for parallel builds, so you may
    want to consider this version if you have a multiprocessor
    system. GNU make 3.77 had a serious flaw in the $(wildcard ...)
    function which prevented us from compiling some parts of the
    library (most of our Makefiles are fixed, though). Other make
    programs (i.e. non-GNU flavours) are not standardized and will
    quite surely fail to work.
  - In case you want to generate the documentation from the header
    files, you only need Perl installed.
  - In case you want the printable documentation, however, you need
    Doc++ and LaTeX installed. It is known that Doc++ version 3.3.13
    is broken and generates invalid Tex, but 3.3.8 is ok.
  - The library generates output in formats readable by GNUPLOT, GMV
    (general mesh viewer), AVS Explorer, Povray, and directly to
    Encapsulated Postscript. GNUPLOT and a postscript viewer (for EPS)
    should be available almost everywhere, GMV is freely available for
    most Unix platforms. Povray is freely available for almost all
    platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most Unix
    flavours. 

Note that we have only tested the library under Unix (extensively
under SunOS and Linux). We believe that it should be possible with
little effort to use it on other platforms as well. In that case it
may be necessary to change some settings in the configure.in script or
in the file common/Make.global_options.in.

In case you didn't find your favourite graphics format above it might
be of interest that it is quite simple to add it to the list of
supported ones (take a look at /base/include/base/data_out_base.h and
/base/source/data_out_base.cc to see how output formats are
implemented).


2) Installation:
================
The whole library usually comes as a .tar.gz file, that is a tarred
file archive which is compressed with gzip. After unpacking it with
gunzip and tar (or tar -xzf if you use GNU tar), you will find several
subdirectories. First run the script
  ./configure
which sets some paths and finds out what compiler you use. ./configure
supports several flags which are discussed further down below. After
configuring, go to the /common subdirectory and type 'make', to obtain
the following help (this output may change slightly over time, just
try it):

=========================================================================

To execute one of the commands, type 'make target-name'. Please note
that building all libraries in debug and optimized mode takes about an
hour on a Sun Ultra 450, so you may want to do this during lunchtime.

In case you have a multi-processor machine, you can call 
'make PAR=-j4 target-name' to let make call multiple instances of the
compiler (in this case four). Since the make files are written in a
way to minimize cross-dependencies, this speeds up compilation by
about the factor given after '-j', at least if you have as many
processors. If you have GNU make 3.78 or higher, it is simpler to
directly call 'make -j4 target-name'.


2.1) Configuration options:
---------------------------

You can give several flags to ./configure:

3) Compiler flags:
==================

Since the ISO C++ standard is still quite new and compilers still
change a lot, you might need to provide special options for the
compiler. We have tried to automatize this process using the
./configure script, but in case something is not as you want it,
change the file common/Make.global_options.in and rerun ./configure in
the top-level directory.

We would like to hear about necessary modifications so that we can
include them into the distribution.


4) Problems, questions, further information:
============================================
Feel free to ask if you have any problems with deal.II. If a
question is of general interest, you may want to use our mailing list,
which can be reached at
  deal@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de
For specific problems, send email to either
  wolfgang.bangerth@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de
or
  kanschat@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de

We are interested in any feedback, whether positive or negative, in
order to determine the directions of future work on the library. We
are also very much interested in incorporating any work and bug fixes
by third parties into the library; you will of course be credited by
name for this.

5) License:
===========
Note that we have not yet fully finished the license under which we
will distribute the library. However, we will keep to the following
principles:
- The library comes free of charge for non-commercial users, but we
  keep a copyright in it. We will grant everyone access to the library
  but we would like to ask you to not further distribute it yourself.
  This is to keep an overview over the number of users and their
  background.
- The libraries may not be stripped of our copyright and shall not be
  used in commercial projects without our written prior consent.
- Scientific publications presenting results obtained with these
  libraries shall state the names of the library and their authors
  (at present Wolfgang Bangerth and Guido Kanschat). There will be future
  articles about the library. You will be notified of their appearance.
  Afterwards, you are kindly required to cite these articles in your
  publications.

Note: Since our institute is evaluated at regular intervals, we are
interested in documenting the use of the programs and libraries we
create. This is the reason for not allowing to freely re-distribute
them. We would also be interested in collecting publications with
results obtained with the aid of these libraries and would therefore
like to ask you to drop us a note about every such publication. Your
publication will then be listed on the DEAL homepage. You see, it works
both ways.
