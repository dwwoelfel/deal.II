active cell: a triangulation cell that is not refined further

boundary component: part of the domain in physical space. Denotes
either function for a curved boundary or the selection of a <<boundary
condition>>

boundary condition: part of the weak formulation of a partial
differential equation

boundary indicator: data of lower dimensional <<triangulation
object>>s, indicating the number of a <<boundary component>>

cell: element of a subdivision, being of the same dimension as the
domain of computation

DG: see <<Discontinuous Galerkin>>

DGFEM: <<Discontinuous Galerkin>> finite element method. 

Discontinuous Galerkin: A Galerkin discretization with all degrees of
freedom in the interior of the grid cells. Continuity between grid
cells is established by jump terms on the cell interfaces.

hex: hexahedron, mapping of the unit cube into the domain

locally finest level: all <<active cell>>s, i.e. the finest cell at each
point of the domain

quad: quadrilateral, mapping of the unit square into the domain

triangulation object: the different kinds of polytopes forming a
triangulation, lines, quadrilaterals and hexahedra
