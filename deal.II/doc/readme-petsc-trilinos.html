    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to PETSc and Trilinos</h1>

    <h3>About PETSc, Trilinos, and the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      interfaces</h3>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface to the <a
							 href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/" target="_top">PETSc</a> and
      <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov" target="_top">Trilinos</a> software
      libraries. Both of these libraries provide lots of functions for linear
      algebra, among other things, for example implementations of a variety of
      linear solvers, as well as various different sparse and dense matrix and
      vector formats. Trilinos also has many subpackages that deal with
      problems that go far beyond linear algebra, for example nonlinear
      solvers, automatic differentiation packages, uncertainty propagation
      engines, etc. Of particular interest to deal.II is their ability to
      provide this functionality both on sequential and parallel (using MPI)
      computers. PETSc is written in C; Trilinos is written in C++ and can be
      considered to be a more modern version of PETSc though both packages are
      under continuing development at their respective national laboratories.
    </p>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has wrapper classes to the linear algebra
      parts of both packages that provide almost the
      same interfaces as the built-in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> linear
      algebra classes. We use these interfaces for parallel computations based
      on MPI since the native deal.II linear algebra classes lack this ability.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuring the interfaces to PETSc and Trilinos</h3>

    <p>
      The use of PETSc and Trilinos is optional. To use the wrapper classes,
      you first have to install these packages and
      point <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> to the
      installation directories. This happens in similar ways for the two
      packages:
    </p>

    <h4>PETSc</h4>

    <p>
      PETSc usually requires you to set the
      environment variables <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>
      to a path to PETSc and denoting the architecture for which PETSc is
      compiled. If these environment variables are set, then
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> will pick them up during
      configuration, and store them. It will then also recognize that
      PETSc shall be used, and enable the wrapper classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, the <code>--with-petsc=DIR</code> and
      <code>--with-petsc-arch=ARCH</code> switches to
      <code>./configure</code> can be used to override the values
      of <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> or if
      these environment variables are not set at all. If you do have a
      PETSc installation and have set the <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and
      <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> environment variables but do not wish
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to be configured for PETSc use, you
      should specify <code>--with-petsc=no</code> as a flag during
      configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an additional caveat: PETSc appears not to co-operate
      well when using threads and some programs crash when deal.II is
      compiled in its usual mode supporting multithreading. If you see
      this sort of behavior, we recommend to try disabling
      multithreading upon configuration of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      using the
      <code>--disable-threads</code> switch to <code>./configure</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Installing both PETSc and deal.II together can be a bit of a
      challenge. A good summary of the relevant steps can be found on
      the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dealii/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions"
	     target="_top">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.
    </p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can be installed with both
      PETSc and Trilinos (see below) and they do not usually get in their
      respective ways. There are, however, occasions where this is not true
      and this fundamentally comes from the fact that both of these packages
      are built from subpackages that are developed by independent
      groups. Unfortunately, some of these sub-packages can be configured to
      be part of both PETSc and Trilinos, and if you try to
      use <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with versions of PETSc and Trilinos
      that <i>both</i> contain a particular sub-package, little good will come
      of it in general. In particular, we have experienced this with the ML
      package that can serve as an algebraic multigrid method to both PETSc
      and Trilinos. If both of these packages are configured to use ML, then
      difficult to understand error messages at compile or link time are
      almost inevitable, and there is little the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      build system can do to prevent this. Thus, <i>don't try to do such a
	thing!</i>
    </p>


    <h4>Trilinos</h4>

    <p>
      As above, set the <code>TRILINOS_DIR</code>
      environment variable to the path to an existing Trilinos installation,
      or use the <code>--with-trilinos=/path/to/trilinos</code> switch of
      the deal.II <code>./configure</code> script. It should point to the path
      of which the include and lib directories are subdirs. The Trilinos
      installation needs to provide the same kind of libraries that
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is configured for, i.e. if you want deal.II
      to use shared libraries, then Trilinos needs to use shared libraries as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> and its tutorial programs use several of the
      Trilinos sub-packages.
    </p>

    <h5>Trilinos starting with version 10.0</h5>

    <p style="color: red">
      Note: Trilinos versions 10.6.x, 10.8.0, 10.8.1, 10.10.2, 10.12.1 are not
      compatible with deal.II. They contain subtle bugs related to (parallel)
      matrices and vectors.  Versions tested to work are 10.4.2, 10.8.5,
      10.12.2, and 11.0.3. We recommend only using one of the tested versions for the time
      being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trilinos uses <a href="http://cmake.org/">cmake</a> to configure and
      build. This is a bit cumbersome because you have to enter
      the following slightly longish set of commands:
      <code>
	<pre>
	  cd trilinos-10.4.2
	  mkdir build
	  cd build

	  cmake -D Trilinos_ENABLE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
	  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Sacado:BOOL=ON \
	  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Stratimikos:BOOL=ON \
	  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RELEASE \
	  -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-g -O3" \
	  -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-g -O3" \
	  -D CMAKE_FORTRAN_FLAGS:STRING="-g -O5" \
	  -D Trilinos_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS:STRING="-lgfortran" \
	  -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=FALSE \
	  -D Trilinos_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE:BOOL=FALSE \
	  -D TPL_ENABLE_MPI:BOOL=OFF \
	  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/w/bangerth/share/x86_64/trilinos-10.4.2 \
	  -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON `pwd`/..

	  make
	  make install
	</pre>
      </code>
      Again, the path into which you want to install Trilinos in the second to
      last line of the cmake command needs to be adjusted. Obviously, if you
      want to use Trilinos with MPI on parallel machines, you also need to
      flip the value of the <code>TPL_ENABLE_MPI</code> flag above. Finally,
      if your computer has more than one processor core, you may want to add
      the <code>-jN</code> flag to the calls to <code>make</code>
      where <code>N</code> is the number of compile jobs you want to run in
      parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trilinos sometimes searches for other libraries but can't find
      them if they are not in the usual directories or have other
      names. A common example are BLAS or LAPACK. In a case like
      this, you may have to specifically pass the directories and/or
      library names under which they can be found
      to <code>cmake</code>. For example, this may mean to add the
      following flags to the call above:
      <code>
	<pre>
	  -D BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=goto \
	  -D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/GotoBLAS/lib64 \
	  -D LAPACK_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=lapack \
	  -D LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/lapack-3.2.1/lib64
	</pre>
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the deal configuration complains about
      <code><pre>
	  configure: error: *** Your Trilinos installation is not compatible with the C++ standard selected for this compiler. See the deal.II FAQ page for a solution. ***
      </pre></code>
      you have encountered a bug in Trilinos. As a workaround,
      include/Sacado_cmath.hpp has to be edited (see <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dealii/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Trilinos_detection_in_./configure_fails_with_an_error_in_the_fil">the FAQ entry for details</a>).
    </p>


    <h3>Configuring for installed Trilinos packages</h3>

    <p>
      The above scheme works if Trilinos is installed in its own directory
      and header and library files are in subdirectories of the directory
      given to <code>--with-trilinos</code>. This scheme doesn't work,
      however, if Trilinos has been installed as a regular package on a
      system, for example into the <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>
      directories.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that case, paths to include and library files may be specified
      separately using the <code>--with-trilinos-include</code>
      and <code>--with-trilinos-libs</code> switches
      to <code>./configure</code>. Alternatively, this information can also
      be passed to the configuration script by setting the environment
      variables <code>TRILINOS_INCDIR, TRILINOS_LIBDIR</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Dealing with other Trilinos packages</h3>

    <p>
      In the commands configuring Trilinos shown above, we have assumed a
      particular subset of Trilinos libraries that deal.II interfaces
      with. However, Trilinos has many more packages that deal.II doesn't
      use, and you can add many more <code>-D
	Trilinos_ENABLE_XXX:BOOL=ON</code> flags for
      package <code>XXX</code>. Most of the time, no harm is done by doing
      so, but there are cases where some of the packages deal.II does
      interact with also interacts with package <code>XXX</code> if the
      latter was enabled in Trilinos. One example is that Trilinos' ML
      package (which we use) uses Trilinos' Zoltan package if Zoltan is
      enable, but not if Zoltan is not enabled. That means that
      the <code>libml.so</code> library may or may not depend on
      a <code>libzoltan.so</code> library.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, Trilinos' configuration framework does not record this
      in <code>libml.so</code>, and it is also something that is difficult
      for the deal.II configuration framework to find out after the
      fact. Consequently, deal.II's Makefiles rely on the fact
      that <i>only</i> the Trilinos packages listed above were enabled. If
      that isn't the case, you may get linker warnings. The only way to
      solve this problem is to add the additional Trilinos libraries at the
      appropriate place in the list of <code>DEAL_II_TRILINOS_LIBS</code>
      libraries in <code>common/Make.global_options</code> by hand.
