    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories. They are
    listed below.
    </p>


    <h4>README file</h4>
      <p>
      The <a href="readme.html" target="body">README file</a> of
      the library. It gives information on system requirements,
      installation, and copyright.</p>

    <h4>Tutorials</h4>
    
      <p>
      The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>:
      for new users of the library. It explains the basic elements of
      finite element programs based on the library, and provides small
      example programs.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another chapter of the tutorial gives an overview of information
      classified by subject. This is more for reference than to learn
      about the library the first time.
      </p>


    <h4>Programming interface</h4>

      <p>
      These are the pages you will need most often as a reference of
      all classes, functions and variables in the library. They are
      extensively documented (presently approximately 1250 pages if
      printed), and are split into several parts, according to the
      sub-libraries and the different directories of the main
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
	 <ul>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/base/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/base</code> library</a>: a set of classes not
                 specifically related to finite elements, but
                 nonetheless important for the overall library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/lac/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/lac</code> library</a>: <em>L</em>inear
		  <em>a</em>lgebra <em>c</em>lasses,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/grid/index.html" target="body">
	        Grid handling</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/dof/index.html" target="body">
	        Degrees of freedom and finite elements</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/numerics/index.html" target="body">
	        Numerical tools</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library.
	 </ul>
      </p>


    <h4>Development information</h4>
  
      <p>
      If you plan to <a href="development/index.html"
           target="_top">develop your own applications</a> using
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
      at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
      page</a>.
      </p>

      
    <h4>Reports</h4>
    
      <p>
      We have a few reports written on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
      the following of which are online:
	 <ul>
	 <li> <p>
	      A <a href="reports/deal.II-paper/index.html" target="body">
	      paper describing the background, purpose and methods</a>
	      of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, by Wolfgang Bangerth and
	      Guido Kanschat. This paper is also available as preprint
	      99-43 from the 
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>.
              </p>

	 <li> <p>
              A brief report about the classes involved in the
	      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
                 target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
	      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
	      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
	      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
              read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
              information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). 
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on how
	      <a href="reports/multithreading/index.html"
                 target="body">multithreading</a> is implemented and
              supported in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). 
	      </p>
	 </ul>
      </p>


    <h4>Publications</h4>

      <p>
      A <a href="publications/toc.html" target="body">list of
      publications</a> about and based on
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can be found on 
      <a href="publications/toc.html" target="body">this</a> page.
      </p>


    <h4>Future</h4>

      <p>
      Finally, we have a page where we list our
      <a href="future.html" target="body">plans for extensions of deal.II in
      the future</a>.
