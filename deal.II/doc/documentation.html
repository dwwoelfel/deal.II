<p>
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with quite extensive online
  documentation, which falls into several categories. They are
  listed below.
</p>

<h2><a href="readme.html">ReadMe</a></h2>

<p>
  First, there is the <a href="readme.html" target="body">README file</a> of
  the library. It gives information on system requirements,
  installation, and copyright.
</p>

<h2><a href="tutorials">Tutorials</a></h2>

<p>
  The <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html"
	 target="_top">tutorial</a> is
  for new users of the library. It explains the basic elements of
  finite element programs based on the library, and provides small
  example programs. You can also reach the tutorial link from the menu bar
  at the left.
</p>

<p>
  Note that along with the rest of the documentation, the local HTML pages
  of the tutorials need to be generated first. Please follow the
  instructions in the
  <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
  this.
</p>


<h2><a href="API">Programming interface</a></h2>

<p>
  The <a href="doxygen/deal.II/index.html" target="_top">programming
    interface/manual</a> pages are what you will need most often as a
  reference of all classes, functions and variables in the library. They
  are extensively documented (presently more than 5000 pages if
  printed), and generated by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/"
				target="_top">Doxygen</a>. There is also a quick link to these pages from
  the menu bar at the left.
</p>

<p>
  The documentation uses many of the features of Doxygen. In particular,
  the link takes you straight to a page that lists <i>modules</i>, a way
  to group classes with similar purposes. This may be what you are probably
  interested in when you are not yet familiar with the library. If you
  already know your way around and want to look up the signature of a
  particular member function, for example, you may go to the class view or
  choose any of the other ways in which Doxygen allows you to navigate
  through the documentation.
</p>

<p>
  Just as for the tutorials, the API docs need to be generated first,
  if you download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
  instructions in the
  <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
  this.
</p>


<h2><a name="dev">Development information</a></h2>

<p>
  If you plan to <a href="development/index.html"
		    target="_top">develop your own applications</a> using
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
  at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
    page</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="reports">Reports</a></h2>

<p>
  There are a number of papers that describe the overall design or
  individual aspects of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please refer to the
  papers listed at the top of the <a href="publications/index.html"
				     target="body">publications page</a> for full references. In addition,
  there are the following reports:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
	A publication on the
	<a href="reports/dimension-independent/index.html"
           target="body">basics of dimension independent
          programming</a> in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
	Bangerth). This explains some of the fundamentals of the
	library's design, though rather briefly due to the page
	limit imposed for the publication.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	This publication appeared in
	the proceedings of the 16th IMACS World Congress,
	Lausanne, Switzerland, 2000. See the
	<a href="publications/index.html" target="body">publications</a>
	page for the full reference as well as a way to obtain a
	reprint of the original paper as a postscript or PDF file.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A brief report about the classes involved in the
      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
         target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
      read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
      information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
      Bangerth).
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A brief report on <a href="reports/mapping_q/index.html"
			   target="body">mapping</a> functions of higher polynomial
      degrees (by Ralf Hartmann). These allow the realisation
      of higher order boundary approximations. This report
      gives the theoretical background of the
      <code>MappingQ</code> class.
    </li>

    <li>
      A report on
      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
         target="body">assembling matrices</a> (by Wolfgang
      Bangerth). This report looks in particular at how
      matrices are assembled for vector-valued problems, and
      how things change if vector-valued finite elements are
      used for which the shape functions have more than one
      non-zero vector component, such as Nedelec or
      Raviart-Thomas elements. There are printable
      versions of the report
      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.ps"
         target="body">in postscript</a> and
      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
         target="body">PDF format</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A very detailed report on
      <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.pdf"
         target="body">Nedelec elements</a> (by Anna
      Schneebeli, University of Basel, Switzerland). It
      explains the construction and application of Nedelec
      edge elements for H-curl spaces, as used, for example,
      in the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It
      also gives numerical results obtained with deal.II.
      There is also a <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.ps"
			 target="body">postscript version of the report</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      A report on the
      <a href="reports/codimension-one/desimone-heltai-manigrasso.pdf"
         target="body">codimension one</a> capabilities of the library
         (by Antonio DeSimone, Luca Heltai and Cataldo Manigrasso,
         SISSA, Trieste, Italy). It explains in detail how to use the
         library for the solution of problems defined on codimension
         one manifolds, such as, for example, Boundary Element
         Methods.
      </li>
  </ul>
