    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories. They are
    listed below.
    </p>


    <h4><a href="readme.html">README</a></h4>

      <p>
      First, there is the <a href="readme.html" target="body">README file</a> of
      the library. It gives information on system requirements,
      installation, and copyright.
      </p>

    <h4>Tutorials</h4>
    
      <p>
      The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>:
      for new users of the library. It explains the basic elements of
      finite element programs based on the library, and provides small
      example programs.
      Another chapter of the tutorial gives an overview of information
      classified by subject. This is more for reference than to learn
      about the library the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that the tutorials need to be generated first, if you
      download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
      instructions in the 
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h4>Programming interface</h4>

      <p>
      These are the pages you will need most often as a reference of
      all classes, functions and variables in the library. They are
      extensively documented (presently approximately 1250 pages if
      printed), and are split into several parts, according to the
      sub-libraries and the different directories of the main
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
      </p>
	 <ul>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/base/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/base</code> library</a>: a set of classes not
                 specifically related to finite elements, but
                 nonetheless important for the overall library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/lac/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/lac</code> library</a>: <em>L</em>inear
		  <em>a</em>lgebra <em>c</em>lasses,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/grid/index.html" target="body">
	        Grid handling</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/dof/index.html" target="body">
	        Degrees of freedom and finite elements</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/numerics/index.html" target="body">
	        Numerical tools</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library.
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/multigrid/index.html" target="body">
	        Multi-level method</a> support of the
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library.
	 </ul>

      <p>
      If you feel unsure in which of the various sublibraries a
      certain class is located, take a look at this 
      <a href="class_index.html" target="body">list of classes by
      sublibrary</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      As for the tutorials, the API docs need to be generated first,
      if you download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
      instructions in the 
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h4>Development information</h4>
  
      <p>
      If you plan to <a href="development/index.html"
           target="_top">develop your own applications</a> using
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
      at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
      page</a>.
      </p>

      
    <h4>Reports</h4>
    
      <p>
      We have a few reports written on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
      the following of which are online:
      </p>
	 <ul>
	 <li> <p>
	      A <a href="reports/deal.II-paper/index.html" target="body">
	      paper describing the background, purpose and methods</a>
	      of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, by Wolfgang Bangerth and
	      Guido Kanschat. This paper is also available as preprint
	      99-43 from the 
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>.
              </p>

         <li> <p>
              A publication on the 
	      <a href="reports/dimension-independent/index.html"
                 target="body">basics of dimension independent
              programming</a> in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This explains some of the fundamentals of the
              library's design, though rather briefly due to the page
              limit imposed for the publication.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      This publication has initially appeared in
              the proceedings of the 16th IMACS World Congress,
              Lausanne, Switzerland, 2000. See the 
	      <a href="publications/toc.html" target="body">publications</a>
	      page for the full reference as well as a way to obtain a
              reprint of the original paper as a postscript of PDF file.
	      </p>

	 <li> <p>
              A brief report about the classes involved in the
	      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
                 target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
	      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
	      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
	      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
              read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
              information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). 
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on how
	      <a href="reports/multithreading/index.html"
                 target="body">multithreading</a> is implemented and
              supported in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This report is also available as preprint
	      2000-11 from the 
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>. However, this report described a
	      previous version of the threading scheme. After
	      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> 3.4, this scheme was replaced by
	      another one that is more flexible and easier to use. While the
	      general observations of the report are still valid, the syntax
	      presented there is no longer. There is a <a
	      href="reports/new-threads/index.html" target="body">short
	      document</a> describing the new syntax and some considerations we
	      had in implementing it.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
	      A brief report on <a href="reports/mapping_q/index.html"
	      target="body">mapping</a> functions of higher polynomial
	      degrees (by Ralf Hartmann). These allow the realisation
	      of higher order boundary approximations. This report
	      gives the theoretical background of the
	      <code>MappingQ</code> class.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on
	      <a href="reports/assemble/index.html"
                 target="body">assembling matrices</a> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This report looks in particular at how
              matrices are assembled for vector-valued problems, and
              how things change if vector-valued finite elements are
              used for which the shape functions have more than one
              non-zero vector component, such as Nedelec or
              Raviart-Thomas elements. There are also printable
              versions of the report 
	      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.ps"
              target="body">in postscript</a> and
	      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
              target="body">PDF format</a>.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A very detailed report on 
	      <a href="reports/nedelec/main.html"
                 target="body">Nedelec elements</a> (by Anna
              Schneebeli, University of Basel, Switzerland). It
              explains the construction and application of Nedelec
              edge elements for H-curl spaces, as used, for example,
              in the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It
              also gives numerical results obtained with deal.II.
	      Since the report has quite a number of formulas and is thus
	      somewhat cumbersome to read, there
              is also a <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.ps"
              target="body">postscript version of the report</a>, as
              well as a <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.pdf"
              target="body">PDF version</a>.
	      </p>
