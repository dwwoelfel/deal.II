    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories. They are
    listed below.
    </p>


    <h3><a href="readme.html">README</a></h3>

      <p>
      First, there is the <a href="readme.html" target="body">README file</a> of
      the library. It gives information on system requirements,
      installation, and copyright.
      </p>

    <h3>Tutorials</h3>

      <p>
      The <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html"
      target="_top">tutorial</a> is
      for new users of the library. It explains the basic elements of
      finite element programs based on the library, and provides small
      example programs. You can also reach the tutorial link from the menu bar
      at the left.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that along with the rest of the documentation, the local HTML pages
      of the tutorials need to be generated first. Please follow the 
      instructions in the
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h3>Programming interface</h3>

      <p>
      The <a href="doxygen/deal.II/index.html" target="_top">programming
      interface/manual</a> pages are what you will need most often as a
      reference of all classes, functions and variables in the library. They
      are extensively documented (presently more than 5000 pages if
      printed), and generated by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/"
      target="_top">Doxygen</a>. There is also a quick link to these pages from
      the menu bar at the left.
      </p>

      <p>
      The documentation uses many of the features of Doxygen. In particular,
      the link takes you straight to a page that lists <i>modules</i>, a way
      to group classes with similar purposes. This may be what you are probably
      interested in when you are not yet familiar with the library. If you
      already know your way around and want to look up the signature of a
      particular member function, for example, you may go to the class view or
      choose any of the other ways in which Doxygen allows you to navigate
      through the documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
      Just as for the tutorials, the API docs need to be generated first,
      if you download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
      instructions in the
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h3>Development information</h3>

      <p>
      If you plan to <a href="development/index.html"
           target="_top">develop your own applications</a> using
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
      at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
      page</a>.
      </p>


    <h3>Reports</h3>

      <p>
	There are a number of papers that describe the overall design or
	individual aspects of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please refer to the
	papers listed at the top of the <a href="publications/toc.html"
	target="body">publications page</a> for full references. In addition,
	there are the following reports:
        <ul>
         <li> <p>
              A publication on the
	      <a href="reports/dimension-independent/index.html"
                 target="body">basics of dimension independent
              programming</a> in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This explains some of the fundamentals of the
              library's design, though rather briefly due to the page
              limit imposed for the publication.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      This publication appeared in
              the proceedings of the 16th IMACS World Congress,
              Lausanne, Switzerland, 2000. See the
	      <a href="publications/toc.html" target="body">publications</a>
	      page for the full reference as well as a way to obtain a
              reprint of the original paper as a postscript of PDF file.
	      </p>

	 <li> <p>
              A brief report about the classes involved in the
	      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
                 target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
	      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
	      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
	      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
              read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
              information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth).
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on how
	      <a href="reports/multithreading/index.html"
                 target="body">multithreading</a> is implemented and
              supported in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This report is also available as preprint
	      2000-11 from the
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>. However, this report described a
	      previous version of the threading scheme. After
	      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> 3.4, this scheme was replaced by
	      another one that is more flexible and easier to use. While the
	      general observations of the report are still valid, the syntax
	      presented there is no longer. There is a <a
	      href="reports/new-threads/index.html" target="body">short
	      document</a> describing the new syntax and some considerations we
	      had in implementing it.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
	      A brief report on <a href="reports/mapping_q/index.html"
	      target="body">mapping</a> functions of higher polynomial
	      degrees (by Ralf Hartmann). These allow the realisation
	      of higher order boundary approximations. This report
	      gives the theoretical background of the
	      <code>MappingQ</code> class.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on
	      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
                 target="body">assembling matrices</a> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This report looks in particular at how
              matrices are assembled for vector-valued problems, and
              how things change if vector-valued finite elements are
              used for which the shape functions have more than one
              non-zero vector component, such as Nedelec or
              Raviart-Thomas elements. There are printable
              versions of the report
	      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.ps"
              target="body">in postscript</a> and
	      <a href="reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
              target="body">PDF format</a>.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A very detailed report on
	      <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.pdf"
                 target="body">Nedelec elements</a> (by Anna
              Schneebeli, University of Basel, Switzerland). It
              explains the construction and application of Nedelec
              edge elements for H-curl spaces, as used, for example,
              in the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It
              also gives numerical results obtained with deal.II.
	      There is also a <a href="reports/nedelec/nedelec.ps"
              target="body">postscript version of the report</a>.
	      </p>

         <li> <p>
              A report on the
	      <a href="reports/codimension-one/desimone-heltai-manigrasso.pdf"
                 target="body">codimension one</a> capabilities
	      of the library (by Antonio DeSimone, Luca Heltai
	      and Cataldo Manigrasso, SISSA, Trieste, Italy). It
              explains in detail how to use the
	      library for the solution of problems defined on codimension
	      one manifolds, such as, for example, Boundary Element Methods.
	 </ul>
