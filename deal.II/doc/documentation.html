    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories. They are
    listed below.
    </p>


    <h4>README file, mailing list archives</h4>

      <p>
      First, there is the <a href="readme.html" target="body">README file</a> of
      the library. It gives information on system requirements,
      installation, and copyright. More specific questions may also
      have been discussed on the mailing list, of which we also have
      an
      <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal/mail/maillist.html" target="body">
      online archive</a>.
      </p>

    <h4>Tutorials</h4>
    
      <p>
      The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>:
      for new users of the library. It explains the basic elements of
      finite element programs based on the library, and provides small
      example programs.
      Another chapter of the tutorial gives an overview of information
      classified by subject. This is more for reference than to learn
      about the library the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that the tutorials need to be generated first, if you
      download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
      instructions in the 
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h4>Programming interface</h4>

      <p>
      These are the pages you will need most often as a reference of
      all classes, functions and variables in the library. They are
      extensively documented (presently approximately 1250 pages if
      printed), and are split into several parts, according to the
      sub-libraries and the different directories of the main
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
	 <ul>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/base/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/base</code> library</a>: a set of classes not
                 specifically related to finite elements, but
                 nonetheless important for the overall library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/lac/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/lac</code> library</a>: <em>L</em>inear
		  <em>a</em>lgebra <em>c</em>lasses,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/grid/index.html" target="body">
	        Grid handling</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/dof/index.html" target="body">
	        Degrees of freedom and finite elements</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library,
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/numerics/index.html" target="body">
	        Numerical tools</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library.
	 </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      If you feel unsure in which of the various sublibraries a
      certain class is located, take a look at this 
      <a href="class_index.html" target="body">list of classes by
      sublibrary</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      As for the tutorials, the API docs need to be generated first,
      if you download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
      instructions in the 
      <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe file</a> on how to do
      this.
      </p>


    <h4>Development information</h4>
  
      <p>
      If you plan to <a href="development/index.html"
           target="_top">develop your own applications</a> using
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
      at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
      page</a>.
      </p>

      
    <h4>Reports</h4>
    
      <p>
      We have a few reports written on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
      the following of which are online:
	 <ul>
	 <li> <p>
	      A <a href="reports/deal.II-paper/index.html" target="body">
	      paper describing the background, purpose and methods</a>
	      of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, by Wolfgang Bangerth and
	      Guido Kanschat. This paper is also available as preprint
	      99-43 from the 
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>.
              </p>

         <li> <p>
              A publication on the 
	      <a href="reports/dimension-independent/index.html"
                 target="body">basics of dimension independent
              programming</a> in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This explains some of the fundamentals of the
              library's design, though rather briefly due to the page
              limit imposed for the publication.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      This publication has initially appeared in
              the proceedings of the 16th IMACS World Congress,
              Lausanne, Switzerland, 2000. See the 
	      <a href="publications/toc.html" target="body">publications</a>
	      page for the full reference as well as a way to obtain a
              reprint of the original paper as a postscript of PDF file.
	      </p>

	 <li> <p>
              A brief report about the classes involved in the
	      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
                 target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
	      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
	      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
	      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
              read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
              information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth).

         <li> <p>
              A report on how
	      <a href="reports/multithreading/index.html"
                 target="body">multithreading</a> is implemented and
              supported in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> (by Wolfgang
              Bangerth). This report is also available as preprint
	      2000-11 from the
