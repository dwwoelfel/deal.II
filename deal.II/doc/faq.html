  <h1>The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> FAQ</h1>

  This is a short list of questions that are asked frequently on the

  <h4><a name="compiler"></a>How do I change the compiler?</h4>

  <p>
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can be compiled by a number of compilers
  without problems (see the section <a
  href="readme.html#prerequisites">prerequisites</a> in the readme
  file). If the ./configure script does not pick the right one,
  selecting another is simple, and described in an
  <a href="http:readme.html#choose-compiler">according
  section</a> in the <a href="http:readme.html">readme file</a>.

  <h4><a name="triangles"></a>Can I use/implement
  triangles/tetrahedra in <acronym>deal.II</acronym>?</h4>

  <p>
  No, you cannot do either. The basic data structures are too much
  tailored to quadrilaterals and hexahedra. Implementing other cells
  amounts to re-implementing nearly all grid and DoF classes from
  scratch. On the other hand, the restriction to quadrilaterals and
  hexahedra avoids a large number of run-time computations and makes
  the library as fast as it is.
  <p>



  <h4><a name="problem-types"></a>Can I solve problem XXX
  with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>?</h4>

  <p>
  The simple answer is: if it can be written as a PDE, then this is
  possible. The more complicated answer is: <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
  is not a problem-solving environment, it is a toolbox that supports
  you in solving a PDE by the method of finite elements. You will have
  to implement assembling matrices and right hand side vectors
  yourself, as well as nonlinear outer iterations, etc. However, you
  will not need to care about programming a triangulation class that
  can handle locally refined grids in one, two, and three dimensions,
  linear algebra classes, linear solvers, different finite element
  classes, etc.

  <p>
  To give only a very brief overview of what is possible, here is a
  list of the nontrivial problems that were treated by the programs
  that only the main authors wrote to date:
  <ul>
  <li> Time-dependent acoustic and elastic wave equation, including
       nonlocal absorbing boundary conditions;
  <li> Stokes flow discretized with the discontinous Galerkin finite
       element method;
  <li> General hyperbolic problems including Euler flow, using the
       discontinous Galerkin finite element method;
  <li> Distributed parameter estimation problems.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  Problems other users of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> have solved includ
  <ul>
  <li> Elastoplasticity;
  <li> Porous media flow;
  <li> Time dependent large deformation problems for metal forming;
  <li> Eulerian coordinates problems in biomechanical modeling.
  </ul>
  Probably, many other problem types are solved by the many users
  which we do not know of directly. If someone would like to have his
  project added to this page, just contact us.
