    <a name="prerequisites"></a>
    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <a name="supported"></a>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is mostly developed on Linux using the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> compiler. However, it is not
      platform specific and we strive to keep the source code C++
      standard compliant.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should work on the following
      platforms:
      <ul>
	<li>Linux: using the GCC compiler versions 4.0 or later; using the
	  clang compiler version 3.1 or later.
	<li>Mac OS X: using the GCC compiler version 4.0 or later (Please see
          the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dealii/w/list"
		 target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a> for installation issues);
	<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com"
               target="_top">Cygwin/Windows</a> with recent GCC
          versions. For <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Windows"
			   target="_top">installing on Windows</a>, please refer to
          additional information on
          the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dealii/w/list"
		 target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a>!
      </ul>
      Most other combinations of POSIX-style operating systems and C++
      standards compliant compilers should also work. If they don't, please
      report it as a bug.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many C++ compilers out there. Our experience is that,
      unfortunately, most of them do not fully support the C++ 1998 standard
      upon which we build, and they eventually fail on a project as large as
      deal.II. Your best bet is to stick with the ones listed above. The only
      platform where this is not trivial is Microsoft Windows where the widely
      used Microsoft Visual C++ compiler simply has too many bugs supporting
      advanced C++ code.
    </p>


    <a name="additional-software"></a>
    <h3>Additional software requirements</h3>

    In order to compile and use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    libraries you need to have the following programs installed:
    <ul>
      <li> <p>
          Perl: Any Perl 5.x version should work.
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          Make: We use <a href="http://www.gnu.org"
			  target="_top">GNU make</a>, version 3.78 or later. Other make
          programs (i.e. non-GNU) will usually fail
          to work and are not supported.
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          For debugging programs, we have found that the
	  <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">GNU
	    debugger gdb</a> is a valuable tool. Other options
	  are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/" target="_top">DDD</a>
	  and <a href="http://www.kdbg.org/" target="_top">kdbg</a>, both of
	  which have graphical user interfaces. Most integrated development
	  environments like <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/"
			       target="_top">kdevelop</a> or
	  <a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_top">Eclipse</a> have built
	  in debuggers as well.
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          In case you want to generate the documentation locally on your
	  machine from the header <acronym>deal.II</acronym> files, you need a
	  copy of <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>
	  on your machine. If not, you can still work with the library and
	  use the documentation provided on our homepage for reference. Note
          that in order to generate inheritance graphs for classes, doxygen
          can use the <code>dot</code> program, which is part of the <a
									href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a>
          package. If this program is not available, then doxygen attempts to
          generate text-mode graphs; these are much less nice, though.
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          The library generates output in formats readable by
          <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/gnuplot/gnuplot-faq.html" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
	  <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" target="_top">GMV
 	    (general mesh viewer)</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.amtec.com" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
          <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/"
             target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>,
          and directly to Encapsulated Postscript. GNUPLOT and a
          postscript viewer (for EPS) should be available almost
          everywhere. In the last few years, most new visualization
          programs have moved to support VTK/VTU format. There are a
          number of excellent programs that can read VTK and VTU, such as <a
									     href="http://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">Visit</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Index.html"
             target="_top">ParaView</a>, as well as others.
	  Povray is freely available for almost all
          platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most
          Unix flavors. Tecplot is a commercial program available for
          Windows and most Unix platforms.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above, adding a new
	  writer to <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is not too difficult as only a
	  simple
	  intermediate format needs to be
	  converted into output (without references to cells,
	  nodes, types of finite elements, and the like).
	</p>
    </ul>




    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <a name="unpacking"></a>
    <h3>Unpacking</h3>
    The whole library usually comes as a .tar.gz file, that is a
    tarred file archive which is compressed with gzip. After downloading this
    tar file, please unpack it at the position where you want to install the
    deal.II library using either
    <pre>

      gunzip deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
      tar xf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar
    </pre>
    or, if you have GNU tar with
    <pre>

      tar xzf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    </pre>
    Unpacking will create a subdirectory <tt>deal.II</tt> with
    the whole library wherever you do it. Since deal.II does not have
    a <tt>make install</tt> which would copy the libraries to a final position,
    this subdirectory is where the built library will reside.

    <a name="configuration"></a>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    <p>
      Unpacking will create a subdirectory <tt>deal.II</tt>. First run
      <pre>

	cd deal.II
	./configure
      </pre>
      to set some paths and find out your system parameters. <tt>configure</tt>
      supports several flags which are discussed
      further down <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>./configure</code> creates the
      file <code>deal.II/common/Make.global_options</code>,
      which remembers paths and configuration options. Please note that it is not
      possible to move the library directory after configuration. Neither will
      the library compile, nor will your application programs be able to use it.
      You can
      use <code>deal.II/common/Make.global_options</code> in the
      <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">Makefiles
	of your own projects</a> to set relevant paths and parameters correctly.
    </p>

    <a name="building"></a>
    <h3>Building the library</h3>
    After configuring, type <tt>make</tt>, to obtain the following help (this
    output may change slightly over time, just try it):

    <pre>
      ========================================================================
      =              Global Makefile for the deal.II libraries               =
      ========================================================================
      =                                                                      =
      = The following targets exist:                                         =
      =    all        : debug and optimized libraries                        =

      =    optimized  : the optimized version of the deal.II library         =
      =                                                                      =

      =                                                                      =
      =    online-doc : generate the documentation in HTML format            =
      =    TODO       : create a "TODO" file from the source files           =
      =    TAGS       : create a TAGS file from include and source files     =
      =                                                                      =
      =    clean      : removes all object files in subdirs                  =
      =    distclean  : removes all object files, libraries, etc in subdirs  =
      ========================================================================
    </pre>

    <p>
      To execute one of the commands, type for example <code>make
	all</code>. Building all libraries takes somewhere between 4 minutes
      and several hours, depending on the number of processors your machine
      has, and requires about 2 GB of free disk space. If you have a
      multi-processor machine, you can call <code>make -j16 all</code>
      to let <code>make</code> call multiple instances of the compiler
      (in this case sixteen). This speeds up compilation by about
      the factor given after <code>-j</code>, at least if you have as many
      processors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> libraries come in two versions
      corresponding to their respective targets:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p><code>lib/libdeal_II.g</code>: This is the
	    debug version of the library. It is compiled with compiler flags so
	    that the library contains information that can be used by debuggers. (The
	    infix <code>.g</code> was historically chosen because gcc uses the
	    flag <code>-g</code> to request debugging information).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In addition, this library contains a great number of safety
	    checks on most arguments of all functions you could possibly call.
	    These assertions have proven to be an
	    invaluable means to finding programming bugs since they will
	    almost always abort your program if something goes wrong. In our
	    experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
	    parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc) and they
	    are usually found almost instantaneously displaying the file
	    name and line number of where the problem occurred.
	  </p>

	<li> <p><code>lib/libdeal_II</code>: This is the
	    optimized version of the library. You will want to link with it
	    once you know that your program is working as expected. This
	    version of the library does not contain the safety checks any more
	    and is compiled with aggressive compiler optimizations. The
	    resulting executables are smaller and will run between 2 and 10
	    times faster than the debug executables.
	  </p>
      </ul>
      Each library file will have a suffix that depends on the system.
      If static libraries were requested during
      configuration, then the suffix is <code>.a</code>. For shared
      libraries, it is <code>.so</code> (for most Unix-like and Linux
      systems), <code>.dylib</code> (for Mac OS X), or <code>.dll</code>
      (for Cygwin/Windows).
    </p>

    <p>
      Apart from the libraries, you can generate the full set of
      documentation files, by typing <code>make online-doc</code>; this takes
      some minutes but you will
      have (almost) all the documentation locally on your computer. You
      will then be able to access it through <a
						href="documentation.html" target="body">this page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write
      programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you are new to
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
      <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.
    </p>


    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <a name="choose-compiler"></a>
    <h4>Changing the compiler or compiler flags</h4>

    To instruct <code>configure</code> to use a particular compiler, there are two
    options: first, you can prepend your search path by the directory
    of the desired compiler. Alternatively, if your full compiler paths are
    <tt>mycc</tt> and <tt>myc++</tt> (for example) for your C and C++ compilers,
    respectively, type into your <tt>csh</tt>:
    <pre>
      setenv CC  mycc
      setenv CXX myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>
    or into your <tt>bash</tt>
    <pre>
      export CC=mycc
      export CXX=myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>

    <p>
      The paths to these compilers are stored in the
      <code>common/Make.global_options</code> files, so the compilers
      are always used when compiling the library even if the environment
      variables are not set later on any more (for example if you are working
      within another window, or have unset the variables for other
      purposes).
    </p>

    <p>
      If all you want to do is pass different compiler flags to the
      compiler, set the standard environment variables <code>CXXFLAGS,
	CFLAGS, LDFLAGS</code> before calling
      <code>./configure</code>. For example, to produce
      <code>gprof</code> output, do:
      <pre>
	setenv CXXFLAGS -pg
	setenv LDFLAGS -pg
	./configure &lt;configure-options&gt;
      </pre>
      The flags so set are used for both optimized and debug mode. If you want to
      set flags for only one of these two cases, you should
      set <code>CXXFLAGSO</code> or <code>CXXFLAGSG</code>, respectively.
    </p>


    <a name="optional">
      <h4>Selecting optional behavior</h4></a>

    You can give several flags to ./configure:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>--enable-shared</code>: Compile the files of deal.II into
	  shared libraries, rather than statically linked
	  libraries. Enabling this option saves disk space, link time and
	  start-up time, so this is the default. Some systems
	  might not support shared libraries, in which case you should
	  call ./configure with the parameter
	  <code>--disable-shared</code>.
	</p>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>--enable-threads</code>: This flag indicates that those
	  parts of the library that support this compute in parallel,
	  using multiple threads, making programs significantly faster on
	  machines with multiple cores or processors. The default is to
	  use multiple threads since most machines today have several
	  processor cores. If this is not desired,
	  use <code>--disable-threads</code>.

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <code>--enable-mpi</code>: If given this
	      flag, <code>./configure</code> chooses <code>mpiCC</code>
	      and <code>mpicc</code> as the C++ and C compilers, respectively,
	      unless the <code>$CXX</code> and <code>$CC</code> environment
	      variables have specifically been set to something else. If these
	      compilers exist and indeed support MPI, then this also switches
	      on support for MPI in the library.
	    </p>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <code>--with-cpu=...</code>: Enable specific optimization
	      flags for a particular processor. Programs compiled with these options
	      might not execute on another system, but may be faster on the
	      particular CPU selected.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      For a complete list of supported values of this switch, you may
	      take a look at the file <code>aclocal.m4</code> in the top-level
	      directory. However, the most commonly used value
	      is <code>--with-cpu=native</code>, indicating that the compiler
	      should determine the CPU we are running on by itself and
	      optimize for it.
	    </p>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <code>--with-doxygen=...</code>: Select the specified executable
	      of <code>doxygen</code> over the one automatically found by
	      <code>./configure</code>. May also be used if no
	      <code>doxygen</code> can be found automatically.
	    </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <code>./configure</code> stores the paths to some
      programs, such as the compilers or the Perl interpreter. The
      compiler which will be used when compiling the library (or your
      own application) is therefore selected at the time of
      configuration and independent of the setting of your $PATH
      environment value at the time when you run <code>make</code>. If
      you want to change the compiler used, you will therefore have
      to re-run ./configure.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is in general a good idea to run <code>make clean</code>
      before re-configuring.
    </p>




    <a name="optional-software"></a>
    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p> <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with built-in support for a
      number of external software packages. These packages are
      sometimes detected automatically, sometimes they must be enabled explicitly
      during configuration by adding the option <tt>--with-package</tt>.
      Supported software packages are (the following list contains
      trademarks belonging to their owners):
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>TECPLOT</dt>
      <dd>Autodetected if one of the variables <tt>$TECHOME</tt>,
	<tt>$TEC80HOME</tt> or <tt>$TEC90HOME</tt> points to a valid installation
	of the tecio library. If enabled, allows data output in TECPLOT format.
      </dd>

      <a name="umfpack"></a>
      <dt>UMFPACK</dt>
      <dd>Enabled by <tt>--with-umfpack</tt>. If no argument is given,
	use the version of UMFPACK that comes bundled with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you
	want a different version of UMFPACK, provide the path to that
	version as an argument. Enabling UMFPACK adds the
	class <tt>SparseDirectUMFPACK</tt> to the library. The default is to not
	use UMFPACK.

	<p>
	  If you want to use an external installation of UMFPACK, but UMFPACK was
	  installed as
	  part of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local
	  directories in a home directory for example, you can use configure
	  switches <code>--with-umfpack-include, --with-umfpack-libs</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Note that UMFPACK has its own license; if
	  you want to use it with deal.II, please read it and make sure that you
	  agree with it. You can find the license of UMFPACK <a
								href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/">here</a>. We
	  include UMFPACK in the deal.II distributions courtesy of its author,
	  <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~davis/">Timothy A. Davis</a>.

	  the <code>SLEPC_DIR</code> environment variable by
	  passing <code>--with-slepc=/path/to/slepc</code>
	  to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> script.
	  The use of SLEPc is optional, however, for the interface with
	  SLEPc to work at all, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s interface to
	  PETSc must also be configured correctly (see the notes above on
	  how to do this).

	  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can also interface
	  to <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov" target="_top">Trilinos</a>. The
	  simplest way to use these interfaces is to
	  pass <code>--with-trilinos=/path/to/trilinos</code>
	  to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> script.  Note
	  that not all versions of Trilinos are compatible
	  with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>.  More details about compatibility and

	<p>
	  In order to generate partitionings of triangulations, we have
	  functions that
	  call <a href="http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview"
		  target="_top">METIS</a> library. METIS is a library that
	  provides various methods to partition graphs, which we use to
	  define which cell belongs to which part of a
	  triangulation. The main point in using METIS is to generate
	  partitions so that the interfaces between cell blocks are as
	  small as possible. This data can, in turn, be used to
	  distribute degrees of freedom onto different processors when
	  using PETSc and/or SLEPc in parallel mode.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As with PETSc and SLEPc, the use of METIS is optional.  If you
	  wish to use it, you can do so by having a METIS installation
	  around at the time of calling
	  <code>./configure</code> by either setting
	  the <code>METIS_DIR</code> environment variable denoting the
	  path to the METIS library, or using the
	  <code>--with-metis</code> flag.
	</p>

	<p>
	  (<acronym>deal.II</acronym>) version 7.2 (and higher) support
	  METIS 5.x.x only; earlier releases are no longer
	  supported.  <br>METIS is not needed when
	  using <code>p4est</code> to parallelize programs, see below.

      <a name="p4est"></a>
      <dt>p4est</dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  p4est is a library that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses to
	  distribute very large meshes across multiple processors (think
	  meshes with a billion cells on 10,000 processors). Using and
	  installing p4est is discussed <a href="external-libs/p4est.html"
					   target="body">here</a>.
	  To configure <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with p4est, you will
	  need to use the <code>--with-path=/path/to/path</code>
	  switch to the <code>./configure</code> script.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <a name="blas"></a>
      <dt>BLAS, LAPACK</dt>

      <dd> <p>If <code>--with-blas=blasname</code> and/or
	  <code>--with-lapack=lapackname</code> is given, provide wrappers
	  around some of the BLAS and LAPACK functions, and link with the
	  respective libraries. It will make sure that we link with the
	  required FORTRAN libraries. If no argument is given to
	  <code>--with-blas</code>, then a BLAS library
	  <code>libblas.a</code> or <code>libblas.so</code> is searched for
	  in the default locations of your system, and similarly for LAPACK.</p>

	<p>If your BLAS or LAPACK libraries are not in the standard search
	  path of your linker, you have to tell the linker where to find them.
	  The path is not given as an argument to
	  <code>--with-blas</code>. Rather, you set the variable
	  <code>LDFLAGS</code> accordingly or make sure that the path is in
	  your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or similar. For details, please
	  look up the documentation of your linker. An example configuration
	  for Linux is:</p>
	<pre>
	  ./configure --with-blas=myblas LDFLAGS=-L/my/lib/
	</pre>
	<p> This example will search for a library
	  <code>libmyblas.a</code> or <code>libmyblas.so</code> in the
	  directory <code>/my/lib</code> and elsewhere in the system library
	  paths.</p>

	<p>Some versions of BLAS and LAPACK need additional libraries
	  to be linked with. Such an example is the
	  <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">automatically tuned
	    linear algebra software (ATLAS)</a>. The BLAS version of this
	  package also needs declarations from <code>libatlas.a</code>,
	  so it must be included. Using the standard library names of
	  atlas, the include for BLAS reads
	  <pre>
	    ./configure --with-blas='f77blas -latlas'
	  </pre>
	  assuming that the library files <code>libf77blas.a</code> and
	  <code>libatlas.a</code> or the respective shared libraries
	  <code>*.so</code> are in libraries included in
	  <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. LAPACK generated by ATLAS is
	  included in a similar fashion.</p>
