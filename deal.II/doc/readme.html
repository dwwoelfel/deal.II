    <a name="prerequisites"></a>
    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <a name="supported"></a>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is mostly developed on Linux using the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> compiler. However, it is not
      platform specific and we strive to keep the source code C++
      standard compliant.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should work on the following
      platforms:
      <ul>
	<li>Linux: using the GCC compiler versions 4.0 or later; using the
	  Clang compiler version 3.0 or later; using the ICC compiler
          version 12 or later.
	<li>Mac OS X: using the GCC compiler version 4.0 or later (Please see
          the <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Main_Page"
		 target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a> for installation issues);
	<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com"
               target="_top">Cygwin/Windows</a> with recent GCC
          versions. For <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Windows"
			   target="_top">installing on Windows</a>, please refer to
          additional information on
          the <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Main_Page"
		 target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a>!
      </ul>
      Most other combinations of POSIX-style operating systems and C++
      Standard compliant compilers should also work. If they don't, please
      report it as a bug.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many C++ compilers out there. Our experience is that,
      unfortunately, most of them do not fully support the C++ 1998 standard
      upon which we build, and they eventually fail on a project as large as
      deal.II. Your best bet is to stick with the ones listed above. The only
      platform where this is not trivial is Microsoft Windows where the widely
      used Microsoft Visual C++ compiler simply has too many bugs supporting
      advanced C++ code.
    </p>


    <a name="additional-software"></a>
    <h3>Additional software requirements</h3>

    <p>
      In order to compile and use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      libraries you need to have the following programs installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <p>
          <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a> version 2.8.8 or later
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_top">GNU make</a>, version
          3.78 or later (or any other generator supported by CMake)
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          For generating the documentation:
          <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>
          and <code>dot</code>, which is part of the
	  <a href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a>
          package
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          For debugging programs, we have found that the
	  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_top">GNU
	    debugger GDB</a> is an invaluable tool. GDB is a text-based tool
	    not always easy to use; <a href="http://www.kdbg.org/"
	    target="_top">kdbg</a>, is one of many graphical user interfaces
	    for it. Most integrated development environments
	    like <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/" target="_top">kdevelop</a>
	    or <a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_top">Eclipse</a> have built
	    in debuggers as well.
	</p>

      <li> <p>
          The library generates output in formats readable by
          <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/gnuplot/gnuplot-faq.html" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
	  <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" target="_top">GMV
 	    (general mesh viewer)</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.amtec.com" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
          <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/"
             target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>,
          and directly to Encapsulated Postscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>gnuplot</code>
          and a postscript viewer (for <code>eps</code>) should be
          available almost everywhere. In the last few years, most
          new visualization programs have moved to support
          <code>vtk</code>/<code>vtu</code> format. There are a number
          of excellent programs that can read <code>vtk</code> and
          <code>vtu</code>, such as
          <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">Visit</a>,
          <a href="http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Index.html" target="_top">ParaView</a>,
	  as well as others. Povray is freely available for almost all
	  platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most Unix
	  flavors. Tecplot is a commercial program available for Windows
	  and most Unix platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above,
	  adding a new writer to <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is not too
	  difficult, as only a simple intermediate format needs to be
	  converted into output (without references to cells, nodes,
	  types of finite elements, and the like).
	</p>
    </ul>




    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <a name="unpacking"></a>
    <h3>Unpacking</h3>

    <p>
      The whole library usually comes as a <code>.tar.gz</code> file,
      which is a file archive compressed with gzip. After downloading it,
      unpack it using either
      <pre>

	gunzip deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
	tar xf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar
      </pre>
      or, if you have GNU tar with
      <pre>

	tar -xvf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
      </pre>
      <b>Note:</b> You will want to hang on to the source files
      of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> after installation as it makes developing
      much simpler. Consequently, you should do the steps above in a permanent
      directory, not on <code>/tmp</code> as one often does when installing
      software.
    </p>

    <a name="configuration"></a>
    <h3>Configuring and building the library</h3>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses the
      <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a>
      integrated configuration and build system. Unpacking will create a
      subdirectory <tt>deal.II/</tt> in the current directory. Then do the
      following steps:
      <pre>

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/install/dir ../deal.II
	make
	make install
      </pre>
      These steps compile, link and install the deal.II libraries. The
      whole process should take between a few minutes and an hour.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>
      <ul>
	<li> <code>/path/install/dir</code> is the directory which deal.II
	  should be installed into. This can be a directory in your home
	  directory (e.g., <code>~/bin/deal.II</code>) or a directory
	  such as <code>/usr/local</code> if you have root privileges.

	<li> If your machine has multiple processors, use <code>make
	  -jN</code> in the last two steps, where <code>N</code> is the
	  number of simultaneous build processes you want <code>make</code>
	  to use at any given time. Allowing <code>make</code> to use
	  more simultaneous build processes (assuming you have that many
	  processor cores) will greatly accelerate the build time.

	<li> If you do not intend to modify the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
	  sources and recompile things, then you can remove
	  the <code>build/</code> directory after the last step.

	<li> The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> <code>CMake</code> system can accept a
	  significant number of configuration parameters. See the
	  discussion <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.

	<li> If you are changing part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
	code itself, you can re-compile the library using only the
	last two commands above but in a previously created build
	directory. It is also possible to change the configuration used
	in this directory by calling <code>cmake</code> a second time,
	possibly with different arguments.
	However, this sometimes leads to surprising results and you may
	not get exactly what you were hoping for. For more information,
	see <a href="development/cmake.html">here</a>.

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The commands above build and install the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      libraries in two variants:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p><i>Debug mode</i>: This version of the
	    library is compiled with compiler flags so
	    that the library contains information that can be used by debuggers.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In addition, this library contains a great number of safety
	    checks on most arguments of all functions you could possibly call.
	    These assertions have proven to be an
	    invaluable means to finding programming bugs since they will
	    almost always abort your program if something goes wrong. In our
	    experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
	    parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc.) and they
	    are usually found almost instantaneously, displaying the file
	    name and line number of where the problem occurred.
	  </p>

	<li> <i>Optimized mode</i>: You will want to link with this version of
	    the library once you know that your program is working as
	    expected. It does not contain the safety checks any more
	    and is compiled with aggressive compiler optimizations. The
	    resulting executables are smaller and will run between 2 and 10
	    times faster than the debug executables.
	  </p>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write
      programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you are new to
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
      <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a large number of optional interfaces to
      other libraries. By default, <code>cmake</code> will enable support
      for all external libraries it can find in default paths.
      However, this behavior can be changed using command line switches to
      the initial call to <code>cmake</code>. A detailed description
      can be found <a href="development/cmake.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following, let us summarize the most common configuration
      options.
    </p>

    <a name="optional">
      <h4>Selecting optional behavior</h4></a>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <i>Threading</i>: By default, deal.II supports parallelism between
	  multiple cores on the same machine using threads and a
	  task-based model built on the
          <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/"
	  target="_top">Threading Building Blocks</a>. You can switch
	  threading off by passing the <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_THREADS=OFF</code>
	  argument to <code>cmake</code>.
	</p>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <i>MPI</i>: To enable parallel computations beyond a single node
	  using the <a href="http://mpi-forum.org/" target="_top">Message
	  Passing Interface (MPI)</a>, pass the
	  <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON</code> argument
	  to <code>cmake</code>. If <code>cmake</code> found MPI but you
	  specifically do not want to use it, then
	  pass <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=OFF</code>.
	</p>

      <li>
        <p>
          To build and install the documentation, specify
          <code>-DDEAL_II_COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION=ON</code>
          on the command line.  For generating the documentation <a
          href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
          <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>
          and <code>dot</code> (which is part of the <a
            href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a>
          package) have to be installed.

      <li>
        <p>
          If you wish to install projects residing under
          <code>contrib/</code> such as ParameterGUI,
          specify <code>-DDEAL_II_COMPONENT_CONTRIB=ON</code>.
          Beware of the fact that parameterGUI needs
          development packages for Qt.

    </ul>




    <a name="optional-software"></a>
    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p>
      When configuring interfacing to external libraries, the
      <code>cmake</code> script by default tries to find all of these
      libraries in a number of standard locations on your file system.
      For <i>optional</i> interfaces, it gives up if the library is not
      found and <acronym>deal.II</acronym> will be built without support
      for them.
      However, there is one interface that we <i>need</i> to have: <a
      href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">BOOST</a>. If it is not
      found externally <code>cmake</code> will resort to the bundled boost
      version that is part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tar file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following paragraphs describe how the interfaces to the
      various packages, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> interacts with,
      can be configured.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Notes:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The majority of libraries mentioned below should be readily
          packaged by most Linux distributions.  Usually you need to
          install a <i>development</i> version of a library package,
          e.g. ending in <code>-dev</code> or <code>-devel</code>.
          After that <code>cmake</code> will automatically find the
          library and use it.
        <li>
          Configuring the interface to a self compiled package,
          say <code>foo</code> can usually be done by specifying
          <code>-DFOO_DIR=/path/to/foo</code>.  Alternatively, you can
          set <code>FOO_DIR</code> as an environment variable in your
          <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> file so that
          you do not have to enter this argument again the next time
          you invoke <code>cmake</code> in a fresh build directory.
          Any value passed on the command line wins over a value that
          may be found in an environment variable.
        <li>
          To explicitly enable or disable support for
          a library <code>foo</code> use the argument
          <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=ON</code> resp.
          <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=OFF</code> for <code>cmake</code>.
    </ul>

	  <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/"
	  target="_top">NetCDF</a> is a library that provides services for
	  reading and writing mesh data (and many other
	  things). <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can use it to read meshes via
          one of the functions of the <code>GridIn</code> class.
	  <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/"
          target="_top">NetCDF</a> should be readily packaged by most
          Linux distributions. (Don't forget to install a develpment
	  version of the library). To use a self compiled version, pass
	  <code>-DNETCDF_DIR=/path/to/netcdf</code> to <code>cmake</code>.

	  <a href="http://www.p4est.org/" target="_top">p4est</a>
	  is a library that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses to
	  distribute very large meshes across multiple processors (think
	  meshes with a billion cells on 10,000 processors). Using and
	  installing p4est is discussed <a href="external-libs/p4est.html"
					   target="body">here</a>.
	  To use a self compiled version, pass the argument
	  <code>-DP4EST_DIR=/path/to/p4est</code> to the
	  <code>cmake</code> command.

	  <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/" target="_top">PETSc</a> is a
	  library that supports parallel linear algebra and many other things.

	  <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/" target="_top">PETSc</a>
	  is already packaged by some Linux distributions and should be
	  found automatically if present. (Don't forget to install a
	  develpment version of the library).  To use a self compiled
	  version of PETSc, add <code>-DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc
	  -DPETSC_ARCH=architecture</code> to the argument list for
	  <code>cmake</code>. The values for these arguments must be
	  the same as those specified when building PETSc.
	</p>

	<p>
	  To disable the PETSc interfaces in cases where <code>cmake</code>
	  automatically finds it, use <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_PETSC=OFF</code>

	<p>
	  <a href="http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/" target="_top">SLEPc</a> is
	  a library for eigenvalue computations that builds on PETSc. Its
	  configuration works just like that for PETSc, except that the
          variable to set is <code>SLEPC_DIR</code> and
          <code>SLEPC_ARCH</code>.
          If <code>SLEPC_ARCH</code> is left empty, <code>cmake</code> will
          use the same architecture as specified in <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>.
	  For the interface with SLEPc to work, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s
	  PETSc interface must also be configured correctly (see above).

	  add <code>-DTRILINOS_DIR=/path/to/trilinos</code> to the

	  The interface will be enabled by default, either using a version
	  installed on your system of using a version that comes bundled
	  with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>.
	  It can be disabled explicitly by using the
	  <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_UMFPACK=OFF</code> argument.
	  To use a self compiled version, pass the argument
	  <code>-DUMFPACK_DIR=/path/to/umfpack</code> to the
