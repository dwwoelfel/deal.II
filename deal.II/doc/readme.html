    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <p>
    At present, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has been
    developed and tested on Unix systems only. It can be used positively on
    <ul>
      <li>Linux ELF with egcs 1.1.x and gcc 2.95.x;
      <li>Sun Solaris 2.5, 2.6, and 7, with egcs 1.1.x and gcc 2.95.x;
      <li>SGI IRIX64 with gcc 2.95.x;
      <li>IBM AIX 4.2, with gcc 2.95.x (with some restrictions on
          the use of shared libraries).
    </ul>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses only very few features of an
    operating system. It should therefore be rather simple to port it
    to other systems, at least with the compilers stated above.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to compile and use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    libraries you need to have the following programs installed:
    <ul>
      <li> <p>
           A fairly complete C++ compiler. We use 
           <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org" target="_top">egcs1.1.2 and
	   gcc2.95</a> but other compilers might work as well. egcs1.0
	   and older gcc versions will not work, however. Also, Sun
           Workshop C++ 5.0 will not work since it does not support
           template member functions, and IBM C Set++ 3.0 will not
           work since they only have non-ISO header file names (with
           appended .h; probably, version 3.0 is not the most recent
           one, but we don't have access to newer ones).
	   </p>

	   <p>
           We are interested in writing portable C++, so if you find
           something that does not work with your compiler, we are
           likely to accept patches.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Perl: any Perl 5.x version should work.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Make: we use <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">GNU make</a>,
           version 3.75. We also use GNU make 3.78 which has much
           better support for parallel builds, so you may want to
           consider this version if you have a multiprocessor
           system. GNU make 3.77 had a serious flaw in the
           <code>$(wildcard ...)</code> function which prevented us
           from compiling some parts of the library (most of our
           Makefiles use a workaround, though). Other make programs
           (i.e. non-GNU) will fail to work.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           In case you want to generate the documentation from the
           header files, you only need Perl installed. The scripts
           generating the documentation are provided.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           In case you want the printable documentation, however, you
           need <a href="http://www.linuxsupportline.com/~doc++/" target="_top">Doc++</a>
	   and LaTeX installed. It is known that Doc++
           version 3.3.13 is broken and generates invalid Tex, but
           3.4 is OK. Note that the printed documentation of the
           classes alone is far more than 1000 pages, so you may not
           want to print it usually. All printable documentation is
           also available online.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           The library generates output in formats readable by
           GNUPLOT, 
	   <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" target="_top">GMV
 	                              (general mesh viewer)</a>, 
	   <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>,
           and directly to Encapsulated Postscript. GNUPLOT and a
           postscript viewer (for EPS) should be available almost
           everywhere, GMV is freely available for most Unix
           platforms. Povray is freely available for almost all
           platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most
           Unix flavors.
	   </p>
    </ul>
    <p>

    In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above it
    might be of interest that it is quite simple to add it to the list
    of supported ones (take a look at
    base/include/base/data_out_base.h and
    base/source/data_out_base.cc to see how output formats are
    implemented).



    <a name="installation">
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    The whole library usually comes as a .tar.gz file, that is a
    tarred file archive which is compressed with gzip. After unpacking
    it with gunzip and tar (or <tt>tar xzf</tt> if you use GNU tar), you will
    find several subdirectories. First run the script 
    <pre><code>
         ./configure
    </code></pre>
    which sets some paths and finds out what compiler you
    use. ./configure supports several flags which are discussed
    further down <a href="#options">below</a>. 

    <p>

    The most important result of <code>./configure</code> is the
    creation of the file <code>common/Make.global_options</code>. This
    file contains compiler options, paths, etc which you may want to
    use in the <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">Makefiles of your own
    projects</a>. It is definitely a good
    idea to include it into your Makefile, to allow using the same
    flags for compilation between library files and the files of your
    project, and to access the paths of the library files. To find
    out about the supported flags, take a look at the file. Also,
    information about Makefiles can be found in the section on
    <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">development</a>.

    <p>

    After configuring, type `make', to obtain the following help (this
    output may change slightly over time, just try it):

    <pre><code>

    ======================================================================
    </code></pre>

    To execute one of the commands, type `make target-name'. Please
    note that building all libraries in debug and optimized mode
    presently takes about an hour on a Sun Ultra 450, so you may want
    to do this during lunchtime. Also, note that building all
    libraries requires 200-250 MB of free disk space (depending on
    platform). 

    <p>

    In case you have a multi-processor machine, you can call `make
    PAR=-j4 target-name' to let `make' call multiple instances of the
    compiler (in this case four). Since the make files are written in
    a way to minimize cross-dependencies, this speeds up compilation
    by about the factor given after `-j', at least if you have as many
    processors. If you have GNU make 3.78 or higher, it is simpler to
    directly call `make -j4 target-name'. Note, however, that
    parallel makes will sometimes fail when compiling the library for
    the first time (this is due to a bug in `make'); in that case,
    simply re-run `make', or run it without `-jN'.

    <p>

    After `make' has finished, you will have two sets of
    libraries. The first consists of the files
    <ul>
      <li> <p><code>base/lib/libbase.a</code>: The library containing the
      code of the classes in the <code>/base</code> directory. These
      are mostly helper classes (such as output of various data in
      different data formats), and classes of general numerical
      interest (such as classes representing functions, tensors,
      etc.), but not very specifically about finite elements.
      </p>

      <li> <p><code>lac/lib/liblac.a</code>: <code>lac</code> is the
      acronym for <i>L</i>inear <i>A</i>lgebra <i>C</i>lasses. This
      library contains classes representing vectors, matrices, sparse
      matrices, linear solvers, and the like.
      </p>

      <li> <p><code>deal.II/lib/libdeal_II_2d.a</code>: This is the
      library containing all the classes representing finite element
      methods, such as grid handling, different finite elements,
      etc. Thus suffix <code>_2d</code> obviously indicates that this
      particularly library was compiled for two spatial dimensions,
      but if you told `make' to do so, there will also be libraries
      for one and three spatial dimensions.
      </p>
    </ul>

    For each library, there will also be another library with the
    suffix <code>.g.a</code> instead of <code>.a</code>. The
    difference between the two sets of libraries is the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>
      The <code>.g.a</code> versions contain debugging
      information. In fact the <code>.g</code> reminds us of the fact
      that gcc is called using the option <code>-g</code> to include
      debugging information into its output.
      </p>

      <p>
      Besides the debugging output the compiler puts into the output,
      the library contains a great number of assertions (presently
      about 2000) checking the validity of parameters to functions and
      internal states. These assertions have proven to be an
      invaluable mean to finding programming bugs since they will
      almost always abort your program if something goes wrong. In our
      experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
      parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc) and they
      are usually found almost instantaneously displaying the file
      name and line number of where the problem occurred.
      </p>

      <p>
      You will want to link your programs against the
      <code>.g.a</code> versions of the libraries while developing
      your programs.
      </p>

      <li>
      <p>
      The <code>.a</code> libraries do not contain debugging
      information nor the assertions. For these reasons, they are much
      smaller and your program will run significantly faster (the
      performance penalty of the <code>.g.a</code> libraries is
      between a factor of two and four, depending on which parts of
      the libraries you use). Furthermore, these libraries are
      compiled with optimization options of the compiler.
      </p>

      <p>
      You will want to link your programs against these libraries when
      they run stable and are used in production mode.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Apart from the libraries, you should generate the full set of
    documentation files, by typing `make online-doc'. This way, you
    have (almost) all the documentation locally on your computer and
    need not use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> homepage in
    Heidelberg. You can access all documentation through <a
    href="documentation.html" target="body">this page</a>. (For
    obvious reasons, the only document that you don't have locally is
    the News page, and the pages that convert the CVS logs into
    HTML. Access them through the <a
    href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal"
    target="_top">global homepage</a>.)
    </p>


    <a name="options">
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    You can give several flags to ./configure:
    <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-shared</code>: Compile the files of deal.II into
      shared libraries, rather than statically linked
      libraries. Enabling this option saves disk space, link time and
      start-up time, so this is the default. However, some systems
      might not support shared libraries, in which case you should
      call ./configure with the parameter
      <code>--disable-shared</code>. (Since on AIX we could not get
      shared libraries right immediately, they are disabled by default
      on this system. Probably, there is a simple work-around, but
      since we do not regularly test there, we did not try very hard.)
      </p>

      <p>
      It is important to note that the actual size of the executable
      program in memory will be larger than when linked statically,
      since the dynamic linker does not remove symbols which are not
      used, in contrast to the static linker. Therefore, more main
      memory will be used when running your applications, but link
      time is significantly reduced.      
      </p>

      <p>
      For IRIX64 systems, you should note that the paths to the shared
      libraries need to be included into your
      <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-multithreading</code>: This sets compiler
      variables such that the resulting program supports
      multi-threading. Basically, for this different system include
      files have to be selected (gcc option -threads) and memory
      allocation has to be made thread-safe; the latter can be done
      for the C++ standard containers by defining
      <code>-D__USE_MALLOC</code>. Note that not all parts of the
      deal.II library are fully thread-safe (though most are and
      multi-threaded programs are working well and routinely) and that
      gcc's runtime library is not thread-safe unless you configure gcc
      with <code>--enable-threads</code> and recompile it. Using a gcc
      that was not configured with this option may lead to errors in
      your threaded programs that are extremely hard to find.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-multithreading=ACE-path</code>: enabling
      multi-threading as shown above does not enable multi-threading
      inside the library itself. However, there are several places
      where multi-threading can be used (in some parts of the graphical
      output routines, the KellyErrorEstimator class and some other
      places), and you can switch to multi-threading using this
      configure option.
      </p>

      <p>
      To support multi-threading in a cross-platform way, we use the 
      <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html" target="_top">ACE
      (Adaptive Communications Environment)</a> library. This needs
      to be installed separately, and the path to its installation
      directory needs to be given to this option. 
      </p>

      <p>
      In our experience, if you want to use ACE on Sun, you should
      compile it for pthreads rather than Solaris threads.
      </p>

      <p>
      Note that the multi-thread support in the library is still
      experimental. While <acronym>deal.II</acronym> runs on a variety
      of Unix systems, we presently support detection of the number of
      CPUs in your system only for Linux and Solaris.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-docxx=doc++-path</code>: if you give the full path
      (including file name of the executable) to the configure script,
      then deal.II will use that file as the Doc++ executable for the
      generation of printable documentation. If you don't specify that
      flag and Doc++ is not in your PATH variable, then it is not
      possible to generate printable documentation.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>

    Please note that running ./configure stores the paths to some
    programs, such as the compilers or the Perl interpreter. The
    compiler which will be used when compiling the library (or your
    own application) is therefore selected at the time of
    configuration and independent of the present setting of your $PATH
    environment value. The reason for this is that presently there are
    still too many incompatibilities between different versions of
    compilers and that compiling different parts of programs with
    different compilers often leads to hard-to-find problems. By
    storing the absolute paths of compilers, we can at least catch
    those problems where different compiler revisions are located in
    different directories.

    <p>

    If you want to use a new compiler version, you will therefore have
    to re-run ./configure with the new compiler being in the $PATH
    environment variable.

    <p>

    It is in general a good idea to run `make clean'
    before re-configuring.



    <a name="compiler">
    <h2>Compiler flags</h2>

    Since the ISO C++ standard is still quite new and compilers still
    change a lot, you might need to provide special options for the
    compiler. We have tried to automatize this process using the
    ./configure script at least for the gcc compilers we use, but in
    case something is not as you want it, change the file
    common/Make.global_options.in and rerun ./configure in the
    top-level directory.

    <p>

    We would like to hear about necessary modifications so that we can
    include them into the distribution.
