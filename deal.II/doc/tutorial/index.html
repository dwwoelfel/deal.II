    <h2>or <acronym>deal.II</acronym> in several easy and some more hard lessons</h2>
    
    <h3>Usage of this document</h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial is split into several parts, starting with an outline of
      the structure of a finite element program, commencing with the stationary
      Laplace problem and advancing to more complicated problems. If you have never
      used <acronym>deal.II</acronym> we recommend that you begin at the beginning and
      advance through the chapters in their proper order. This tutorial contains the
      complete code for every example program and can be used as a reference, too,
      if you are looking for code to solve a specific problem with
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. The 0th chapter, 
      <a href="00.fe_structure/index.html">Structure of a Finite Element Program</a>, can also be used as a reference.

    <h3>On <acronym>deal.II</acronym></h3>
    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is short for Differential Equations Analysis Library, version II,
      which says it all, really. Its purpose is the solution of partial differential
      equations on unstructured, locally refined grids with error control. You can find more
      information on <acronym>deal.II</acronym> and some examples at 
      <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal/">the
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> homepage </a>.
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> was written 
      by the numerics group at the IWR, University of Heidelberg,
      mainly by Wolfgang Bangerth and in parts by Guido Kanschat, but
      several others have contributed as well.

    The structure of this tutorial is as follows:
    <p>

    <h4><a href="00.fe_structure/index.html">Chapter 0: Basic Elements of a
	Finite Element Program</a> </h4>
    <p> (also available in a <a href="00.fe_structure/toc.html">version without frames</a>)
    </p>
    <p>We will discuss the various elements needed for a working
      finite element program and some of the possibilities 
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> offers in this respect.
    </p>
    
    <h4><a href="01.laplace/index.html">Chapter 1: The very simple Laplace
	Problem</a> </h4>
    <p>
      (also available in a <a href="01.laplace/toc.html">version without frames</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      ***********
      We will solve the stationary Laplace problem on a square grid with  
      boundary conditions of the form <code>cos(2*PI*x)cos(2*PI*y)</code>.
      You can also obtain the <a href="01.laplace/source.html">source code</a>.
