    <h1>The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> Tutorial</h1>

    <p>
    This is the tutorial for the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    library. It is divided into several parts, covering different
    aspects of a reference manual:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first chapter contains a 
	  <a href="chapter-2.step-by-step/index.html" target="_top">
	  series of small programs</a> which are meant to provide a
	  step-by-step introduction of a new user to programming with
	  <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. The examples start on a very
	  basic level and demonstrate successively more complex parts
	  of a finite element program.
	</p>

        <p>
          This part is targeted at new users of the library that want
          to learn how to use it and to program with it. It may also
          be used by people who know about the mathematics of finite
          elements, but have never written a finite element program
          themselves. Finally, the programs may also serve as starting
          point for own projects.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          The second chapter gives a 
	  <a href="chapter-1.elements/index.html" target="_top">survey
	  of the tools that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> provides</a>
	  for several important
          parts of finite element programs, for example grid creation,
          creation of matrices, boundary conditions, etc. The sections
          of the chapter contain small code snippets which demonstrate
          the use of the techniques under discussion, but no actual
          programs.
	</p>

        <p>
          This part is probably better suited for more
          experienced users of the library, if you seek for specific
          information on a certain topic.
        </p>
    </ul>
