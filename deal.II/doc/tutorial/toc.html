    <h1>The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> Tutorial</h1>

    This is the tutorial for the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    library. It is divided into several chapters, covering different
    aspects of a reference manual. The first chapter gives a survey of
    the tools that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> provides for several
    important parts of finite element programs, for example grid
    creation, creation of matrices, boundary conditions, etc. The
    sections of the chapter contain small code snippets which
    demonstrate the use of the techniques under discussion, but no
    actual programs.

    <p>

    The second chapter contains a series of small programs which are
    meant to provide a step-by-step introduction of a new user to
    programming with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. The examples start on
    a very basic level and are subsequently getting more complex.

    <p>

    The third chapter covers a complete finite element solution of
    Laplace's equation and the aspects needed for such a project.

    <p>

    Note that the second chapter is only partially finished and
    that the third contains some material, which however is considered
    not very suitable to the purpose it is to serve. We will extend
    the second chapter in the near future and probably replace the
    third one altogether with a more suitable example.



    <h3>The chapters of this tutorial</h3>

    <p>
    The structure of this tutorial is as follows:
    <p>

    <h4><a href="chapter-1.elements/index.html" target="_top">
             Chapter 1: Basic Elements of a
	Finite Element Program</a> </h4>

    <p>We will discuss the various elements needed for a working
      finite element program and some of the possibilities 
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> offers in this respect. This chapter
      does not include working programs, but rather snippets of
      programs. This chapter is probably better suited for more
      experienced users of the library, if you seek for specific
      information on a certain topic.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a new user of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may
      rather want to take a look at the second chapter.
    </p>  

    
    <h4><a href="chapter-2.step-by-step/index.html" target="_top">
    Chapter 2: Various small
    programs demonstrating aspects of the library</a></h4>

    <p>
    This chapter contains several functional programs which
    demonstrate successively more complex parts of a finite element
    program. It is intended for novices to the library and may also be
    used by people who know about the mathematics of finite elements,
    but have never written a finite element program themselves.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="chapter-3.laplace/index.html" target="_top">
           Chapter 3: The very simple Laplace
	   Problem</a> </h4>

    <p>
      NOTE: this example program is not finished and not a good
      example after all. We will probably remove it some time.
    </p>
