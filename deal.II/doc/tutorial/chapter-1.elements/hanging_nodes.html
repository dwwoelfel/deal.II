<h1>Hanging Nodes</h1>

This chapter discusses locally refined grids, which are the only ones with
hanging nodes. A node is called hanging if its value is subject to a 
constraint.
In particular, nodes on the boundary of your domain
are not hanging.

<h2>When do you get hanging nodes ?</h2>

<p>
You get hanging nodes after each refinement. Hanging nodes are those that 
are situated on the boundary of a larger active cell. The global function 
is assumed
to be linear on the boundary of each active cell, therefore the value
of the hanging node must be adjusted accordingly. Newly created nodes that
are not situated on boundaries of larger active cells are not subject to this 
constraint because there is no reason to assume that the global function
is linear on the boundary of a parent cell.
Hanging nodes 
and the constraints they are subject to need to be
taken into account when generating your matrix structure.
This is further discussed in the chapters on
<a href="matrix_structure.html">matrix structure</a> and 
<a href="condense.html">condensing the hanging nodes</a>.
