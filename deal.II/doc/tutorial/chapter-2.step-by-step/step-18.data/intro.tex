This tutorial program is another one in the series on the elasticity problem
that we have already started with step-8 and step-17. It extends it into two
different directions: first, it solves the quasistatic but time dependent
elasticity problem for large deformations with a Lagrangian mesh movement
approach. Secondly, it shows some more techniques for solving such problems
using parallel processing with PETSc's linear algebra; however, as before in
step-17, the program runs just as fine on a single sequential machine as long
as you have PETSc installed. In addition to this, we show how to work around
the main bottleneck of step-17, namely there that we only generated graphical
output from one process, and that this scaled very badly with larger numbers
of processes and on large problems. Finally, a good number of assorted
improvements and techniques are demonstrated that have not been shown yet in
previous programs.

In general, elastic deformation is described by the elastic wave equation
\begin{gather*}
  \rho
\end{gather*}
