This tutorial program is another one in the series on the elasticity problem
that we have already started with step-8 and step-17. It extends it into
two different directions: first, it solves the quasistatic but time
dependent elasticity problem for large deformations with a Lagrangian mesh
movement approach. Secondly, it shows some more techniques for solving such
problems using parallel processing with PETSc's linear algebra; however, as
before in step-17, the program runs just as fine on a single sequential
machine as long as you have PETSc installed. Finally, a good number of
assorted improvements and techniques are demonstrated that have not been shown
yet in previous programs.
