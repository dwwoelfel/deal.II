<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This example shows the basic usage of the multilevel functions in
<tt>deal.II</tt>. It solves Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions
to avoid additional complications due to Dirichlet boundary conditions (there,
some library functionsare missing). In all other respects, it is similar to
step 5.
</p>

<p> In order to allow sufficient flexibility in conjunction with systems of
differential equations and block preconditioners, quite a few different objects
have to be created before starting the multilevel method. These are
<ul>
<li>MGTransfer, the object handling transfer between grids
<li>MGCoarse, the solver on the coarsest level
<li>MGSmoother, the smoother on all other levels
<li>MGMatrix, the matrix object having a special level multipplication.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These objects are combined in an object of type Multigrid, containing the
implementation of the V-cycle, which is in turn used by the preconditioner
PreconditionMG, ready for plug-in into a linear slver of the LAC library.
</p>

<p>
The multilevel method in <tt>deal.II</tt> follows in many respects the outlines
of the various publications by James Bramble, Joseph Pasciak and ??? Xu. In
order to understand many of the options, a rough familiarity with their work is
quite helpful.
