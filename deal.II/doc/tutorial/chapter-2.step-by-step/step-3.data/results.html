<h1>Results</h1>

<p>
The output of the program looks as follows:
<pre><code>
Number of active cells: 1024
Total number of cells: 1365
Number of degrees of freedom: 1089
DEAL:cg::Starting value 0.121094
DEAL:cg::Convergence step 48 value 5.33692e-13
</code></pre>

The first three lines is what we wrote to <code>cout</code>. The last
two lines were generated without our intervention by the CG
solver. The first two lines state the residual at the start of the
iteration, while the last line tells us that the solver needed 47
iterations to bring the norm of the residual to 5.3e-13, i.e. below
the threshold 1e-12 which we have set in the `solve' function. We will
show in the next program how to suppress this output, which is
sometimes useful for debugging purposes, but often clutters up the
screen display.

Apart from the output shown above, the program generated the file
<code>solution.gpl</code>, which is in GNUPLOT format. It can be
viewed as follows: invoke GNUPLOT and enter the following sequence of
commands at its prompt:

Terminal type set to 'x11'
gnuplot> set data style lines
gnuplot> splot "solution.gpl"
</code></pre>
This produces the picture of the solution below left. Alternatively,
you can order GNUPLOT to do some hidden line removal by the command
<pre><code>
gnuplot> set hidden3d
</code></pre>
to get the result at the right:
