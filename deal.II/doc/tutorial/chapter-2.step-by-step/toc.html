<h1>Step-by-Step Examples</h1>

<p>
In this chapter, we present a collecting of small programs, each more
or less built atop of the previous one, which demonstrate various
aspects of the library. The general layout of each such example is as
follows:
<ol>
  <li> A brief description of what the program does and what is new
  compared to the previous programs.
  <li> The program, in commented form.
  <li> The output of the program, with some comments.
  <li> Since the program itself usually is a little bit unreadable
  with all the comments intertwingled, we present the program again,
  with all comments stripped off, to allow getting an overview of it.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
At present, the following programs exist:
</p>

<dl>
      <dt><a href="step-1.html">Step 1</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> everything. We create a grid and show a simple
      way to write it to a file.
      </dd>
    
      <dt><a href="step-2.html">Step 2</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Associate degrees of freedom to each vertex
      and compute the resulting sparsity pattern of matrices. Show
      that renumbering reduces the bandwidth of matrices
      significantly, i.e. clusters nonzero entries around the
      diagonal. 
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="step-3.html">Step 3</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Actually solve Laplace's
      problem. Object-orientation. Assembling matrices and
      vectors. Boundary values.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="step-4.html">Step 4</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> This example is programmed in a
      way that it is independent of the dimension for which we want to
      solve Laplace's equation; we will solve the equation in 2D and
      3D, although the program is exactly the same. Non-constant right
      hand side function. Non-homogeneous boundary values.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="step-5.html">Step 5</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Computations on successively
      refined grids. Reading a grid from disk. Some optimizations.  
      Using assertions. Non-constant coefficient in
      the elliptic operator. Preconditioning of the CG solver for the
      linear system of equations.
      </dd>
