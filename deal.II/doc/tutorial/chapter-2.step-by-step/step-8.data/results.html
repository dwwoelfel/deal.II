<h1>Results</h1>

<p>
There is not much to be said about the results of this program, apart
from that they look nice. All images were made using GMV from the
output files that the program wrote to disk. The first picture shows
the displacement as a vector field, where one vector is shown at each
vertex of the grid:
</p>

<p ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="step-8.data/displacement-vectors.jpg" ALT="displacement-vectors" WIDTH="300">
</p>

<p>
You can clearly see the sources of x-displacement around x=0.5 and
x=-0.5, and of y-displacement at the origin. The next image shows the
final grid after eight steps of refinement:
</p>

<p ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="step-8.data/final-grid.jpg" ALT="final-grid" WIDTH="300">
</p>

<p>
Finally, the x-displacement and y-displacement are displayed separately:
</p>

<p>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<IMG SRC="step-8.data/displacement-x.jpg" ALT="displacement-x" WIDTH="300">
</td>
<td>
<IMG SRC="step-8.data/displacement-y.jpg" ALT="displacement-y" WIDTH="300">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that intuitively one would have expected the
solution to be symmetric about the x- and y-axes since the x- and
y-forces are symmetric with respect to these axes. However, the force
considered as a vector is not symmetric and consequently neither is
the solution.
