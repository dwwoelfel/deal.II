<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
In real life, most partial differential equations are really systems
of equations. Accordingly, the solutions are usually
vector-valued. The deal.II library supports such problems we will show
that that is mostly rather simple. The only more complicated problems
are in assembling matrix and right hand side, but these are easily
understood as well. 
</p>

<p>
In the example, we will want to solve the elastic equations. They are
an extension to Laplace's equation with a vector-valued solution that
describes the displacement in each space direction of a rigid body
which is subject to a force. Of course, the force is also
vector-valued, meaning that in each point it has a direction and an
absolute value. The elastic equations are the following:
</p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><MATH CLASS=EQUATION>
  -
  &pd;<SUB>j</SUB> (c<SUB>ijkl</SUB> &pd;<SUB>k</SUB> u<SUB>l</SUB>)
  =
  0,
  &quad;
  i=1&ldots;d,
</MATH></P>     
<p>
where the values c<SUB>ijkl</SUB> are the stiffness coefficients and
will usually depend on the space coordinates. In
many cases, one knows that the material under consideration is
isotropic, in which case by introduction of the two coefficients
lambda and mu the coefficient tensor reduces to
</p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><MATH CLASS=EQUATION>
  c<SUB>ijkl</SUB>
  =
  &lambda;&delta;<SUB>ij</SUB> &delta;<SUB>kl</SUB> +
  &mu;(&delta;<SUB>ik</SUB> &delta;<SUB>jl</SUB> + 
  &delta;<SUB>il</SUB> &delta;<SUB>jk</SUB>).
</MATH></P>      

<p>
The elastic equations can then be rewritten in much simpler a form:
</p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><MATH CLASS=EQUATION>
   -
   &nabla;(&lambda;+&mu;) (&nabla;u)
   -
   (&nabla;&mu;&nabla;) u
   =
   0
</MATH></P>
<p>
This is the form that we will try to solve. The program that does so
is based on the step-6 program.
