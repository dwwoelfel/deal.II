We see that, as expected, on each refinement step the two solutions
coincide. The difference measured in time of treating each face only
once (second version of the DG method) in comparison with treating
each face twice within a nested loop over all cells and all faces of
each cell (first version), is much less than one might have
expected. The gain is less than 10% on the last refinement steps.
</p>

<p> First we show the solutions on the initial mesh, the mesh after two
and after five adaptive refinement steps.

</p>

<p> And finally we show the final grid (after 5 refinement steps). The
grid is largely concentrated in the vicinity of the jump of the
solution.
