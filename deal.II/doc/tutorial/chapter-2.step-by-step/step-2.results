The program has, after having been run, produced two sparsity
patterns. We can visualize them using GNUPLOT:
<pre><code>
  set data style points
  plot "sparsity_pattern.1"
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
The results then look like this (every cross denotes an entry which
might be nonzero; of course the fact whether the entry actually is
zero or not depends on the equation under consideration, but the
indicated positions in the matrix tell us which shape functions can
and which can't couple, if the equation is a local, i.e. differential
one): 
<TABLE WIDTH="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<IMG SRC="step-2.data/sparsity_pattern_1.jpg" ALT="sparsity-pattern-1" WIDTH="300">

<IMG SRC="step-2.data/sparsity_pattern_2.jpg" ALT="sparsity-pattern-2" WIDTH="300">

</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
The different regions in the left picture represent the degrees of
freedom on the different refinement levels of the triangulation.  As
can be seen in the right picture, the sparsity pattern is much better
clustered around the main diagonal of the matrix after
renumbering. Although this might not be apparent, the number of
nonzero entries is the same in both pictures, of course.
</p>

<p>
A common observation is that the more refined the grid is, the better
the clustering around the diagonal will get.
