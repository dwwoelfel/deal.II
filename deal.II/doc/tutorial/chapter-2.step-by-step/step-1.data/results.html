<h1>Results</h1>

<p>
The program has, after having been run, produced two grids, which look
like this:

<TABLE WIDTH="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<IMG SRC="step-1.data/grid-1.jpg" ALT="grid-1" WIDTH="300">
</td>
<td>
<IMG SRC="step-1.data/grid-2.jpg" ALT="grid-2" WIDTH="300">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The left one, well, is not very exciting. The right one is - at least
- unconventional.
