\section{The maths}

The Heidelberg group of Professor Rolf Rannacher, to which the three main
authors of the deal.II library belonged for the PhD time and partly also
afterwards, has been involved with adaptivity and error estimation for finite
element discretizations since the mid-90ies. The main achievement is the
development of error estimates for arbitrary functionals of the solution, and
of optimal mesh refinement for its computation.

We will not discuss the derivation of these concepts in too great detail, but
will implement the main ideas in the present example program. For a thorough
introduction into the general idea, we refer to the seminal work of Becker and
Rannacher \cite{BR95,BR96r}, and the overview article of the same authors in
Acta Numerica \cite{BR01}; the first introduces the concept of error
estimation and adaptivity for general functional output for the Laplace
equation, while the second gives many examples of applications of these
concepts to a large number of other, more complicated equations. For
applications to individual types of equations, see also the publications by
Becker \cite{Bec95,Bec98}, Kanschat \cite{Kan96,FK97}, Suttmeier
\cite{Sut96,RS97,RS98c,RS99}, Bangerth \cite{BR99b,Ban00w,BR01a,Ban02}, and
Hartmann \cite{HH01,HH01a,HH01b}.

The basic idea is the following: in applications, one is not usually
interested in the solution per se, but rather in certain aspects of it. For
example, in simulations of flow problems, one may want to know the lift or
drag of a body emersed in the fluid; it is this quantity that we want to know
to best accuracy, and whether the rest of the solution of the describing
equations is well resolved is not of primary interest. Likewise, in elasticity
one might want to know about values of the stress at certain points to guess
whether maximal load values of joints are safe, for example. Or, in radiative
transfer problems, mean flux intensities are of interest.

In all the cases just listed, it is the evaluation of a functional $J(u)$ of
the solution which we are interested in, rather than the values of $u$
everywhere. Since the exact solution $u$ is not available, but only its
numerical approximation $u_h$, it is sensible to ask whether the computed
value $J(u_h)$ is within certain limits of the exact value $J(u)$, i.e. we
want to bound the error with respect to this functional, $J(u)-J(u_h)$.

For simplicity of exposition, we henceforth assume that both the quantity of
interest $J$, as well as the equation are linear, and we will in particular
show the derivation for the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions, although the concept is much more general. For this
general case, we refer to the references listed above.  The goal is to obtain
bounds on the error, $J(e)=J(u)-J(u_h)$. For this, let us denote by $z$ the
solution of a dual problem, defined as follows:
\begin{gather}
  a(\varphi,z) = J(\varphi) \qquad \forall \varphi,
\end{gather}
where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the bilinear form associated with the differential
equation, and the test functions are chosen from the corresponding solution
space. Then, taking as special test function $\varphi=e$ the error, we have
that
\begin{gather}
  J(e) = a(e,z)
\end{gather}
and we can, by Galerkin orthogonality, rewrite this as
\begin{gather}
  J(e) = a(e,z-\varphi_h)
\end{gather}
for all possible functions $\varphi_h$ from the discrete test space.

Concretely, for Laplace's equation, the error identity reads
\begin{gather}
  J(e) = (\nabla e, \nabla(z-\varphi_h)).
\end{gather}
For reasons that we will not explain, we do not want to use this formula as
is, but rather split the scalar products into terms on all cells, and
integrate by parts on each of them:
\begin{align*}
  J(e)
  &=
  \sum_K (\nabla (u-u_h), \nabla (z-\varphi_h))_K
  \\
  &=
  \sum_K (-\Delta (u-u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K
  + (\partial_n (u-u_h), z-z_h)_{\partial K}.
\end{align*}
Next we use that $-\Delta u=f$, and that $\partial_n u$ is a quantity that is
continuous almost everywhere, so the terms involving $\partial_n u$ on one
cell cancels with that on its neighbor, where the normal vector has the
opposite sign. At the boundary of the domain, where there is no neighbor cell
with wich this term could cancel, the weight $z-\varphi_h$ can be chosen as
zero, since $z$ has zero boundary values, and $\varphi_h$ can be chosen to
have the same.

Thus, we have 
\begin{align*}
  J(e)
  &=
  \sum_K (f+u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K
  - (\partial_n u_h, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}.
\end{align*}
In a final step, note that when taking the normal derivative of $u_h$, we mean
the value of this quantity as taken from this side of the cell (for the usual
Lagrange elements, derivatives are not continuous across edges). We then
rewrite the above formula by exchanging half of the edge integral of cell $K$
with the neighbor cell $K'$, to obtain
\begin{align*}
  J(e)
  &=
  \sum_K (f+u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K
  - \frac 12 (\partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n'} u_h|_{K'},
              z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}.  
\end{align*}
Using that for the normal vectors $n'=-n$ holds, we define the jump of the
normal derivative by
\begin{gather*}
  [\partial_n u_h] := \partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n'} u_h|_{K'}
  =
  \partial_n u_h|_K - \partial_n u_h|_{K'},
\end{gather*}
and get the final form after setting the discrete function $\varphi_h$, which
is by now still arbitrary, to the point interpolation of the dual solution,
$\varphi_h=I_h z$:
\begin{align*}
  J(e)
  &=
  \sum_K (f+u_h), z-I_h z)_K
  - \frac 12 ([\partial_n u_h],
              z-I_h z)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}.  
\end{align*}

With this, we have obtained an exact representation of the error of the finite
element discretization with respect to arbitrary (linear) functionals
$J(\cdot)$. Its structure is a weighted form of a residual estimator, as both
$f+\Delta u_h$ and $[\partial_n u_h]$ are cell and edge residuals that vanish
on the exact solution, and $z-I_h z$ are weights indicating how important the
residuals on a certain cell is for the evaluation of the given functional.
Furthermore, it is a cell-wise quantity, so we can use it as a mesh refinement
criterion. The question, is: how to evaluate it? After all, the evaluation
requires knowledge of the dual solution $z$, which carries the information
about the quantity we want to know to best accuracy.

In some, very special cases, this dual solution is known. For example, if the
functional $J(\cdot)$ is the point evaluation, $J(\varphi)=\varphi(x_0)$, then
the dual solution has to satisfy
\begin{gather*}
  -\Delta z = \delta(x-x_0),
\end{gather*}
with the Dirac delta function on the right hand side, and the dual solution is
the Green's function with respect to the point $x_0$. For simple geometries,
this function is analytically known, and we could insert it into the error
representation formula.

However, we do not want to restrict ourselves to such special cases. Rather,
we will compute the dual solution numerically, and approximate $z$ by some
numerically obtained $\tilde z$. We note that it is not sufficient to compute
this approximation $\tilde z$ using the same method as used for the primal
solution $u_h$, since then $\tilde z-I_h \tilde z=0$, and the overall error
estimate would be zero. Rather, the approximation $\tilde z$ has to be from a
larger space than the primal finite element space. There are various ways to
obtain such an approximation (see the cited literature), and we will choose to
compute it with a higher order finite element space. While this is certainly
not the most efficient way, it is simple since we already have all we need to
do that in place, and it also allows for simple experimenting. For more
efficient methods, again refer to the given literature, in particular
\cite{BR95,BR96r,BR01}.

With this, we end the discussion of the mathematical side of this program and
turn to the actual implementation.
