In <a href="step-18.html" target="body">step-18</a>, we saw a need to write
output files in an intermediate format: in a parallel program, it doesn't scale
well if all processors participate in computing a result, and then only a
single processor generates the graphical output. Rather, each of them should
generate output for its share of the domain, and later on merge all these
output files into a single one.

Thus was the beginning of step-19.
