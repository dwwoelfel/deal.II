<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
In <a href="step-18.html" target="body">step-18</a>, we saw a need to write
output files in an intermediate format: in a parallel program, it doesn't scale
well if all processors participate in computing a result, and then only a
single processor generates the graphical output. Rather, each of them should
generate output for its share of the domain, and later on merge all these
output files into a single one.
</p>

<p>
Thus was the beginning of step-19: it is the program that reads a number of
files written in intermediate format, and merges and converts them into the
final format that one would like to use for visualization. It can also be used
for the following purpose: if you are unsure at the time of a computation what
graphics program you would like to use, write your results in intermediate
format; it can later be converted, using the present program, to any other
format you may want.
</p>

<p>
While this in itself was not interesting enough to make a tutorial program, we
have used the opportunity to introduce one class that has proven to be
extremely help- and useful in real application programs, but had not been
covered by any of the previous tutorial programs: the
<code>ParameterHandler</code> class. This class is used in applications that
want to have some of their behavior determined at run time, using input
files. For example, one may want to specify the geometry, or specifics of the
equation to be solved, at run time. Other typical parameters are the number of
nonlinear iterations, the name of output files, or the names of input files
specifying material properties or boundary conditions.
</p>

<p>
Working with such parameter files is not rocket science. However, it is rather
tedious to write the parsers for such files, in particular if they should be
extensible, be able to group parameters into subsections, perform some error
checks such as that parameters can have only certain kinds of values (for
example, it should only be allowed to have integer values in an input file for
parameters that denote a number of iteration), and similar requirements. The
<code>ParameterHandler</code> class allows for all this: an application program
will declare the parameters it expects (or call a function in the library that
declares a number of parameters for you), the <code>ParameterHandler</code>
class then reads an input file with all these parameters, and the application
program can then get their values back from this class.
