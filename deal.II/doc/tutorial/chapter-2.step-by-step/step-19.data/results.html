<p>
With all that above, here is first what we get if we just run the program
without any parameters at all:
<code>
<pre>
examples/step-19> ./step-19 

Converter from deal.II intermediate format to other graphics formats.

Usage:
    ./step-19 [-p parameter_file] list_of_input_files 
              [-x output_format] [-o output_file]

Parameter sequences in brackets can be omitted if a parameter file is
specified on the command line and if it provides values for these
missing parameters.

The parameter file has the following format and allows the following
values (you can cut and paste this and use it for your own parameter
file):

# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# A dummy parameter asking for an integer
set Dummy iterations = 42

# The name of the output file to be generated
set Output file      = 

# A name for the output format to be used
set Output format    = gnuplot


subsection DX output parameters
  # A boolean field indicating whether neighborship information between cells
  # is to be written to the OpenDX output file
  set Write neighbors = true
end


subsection Dummy subsection
  # A dummy parameter that shows how one can define a parameter that can be
  # assigned values from a finite set of values
  set Dummy color of output = red

  # A dummy parameter that can be fed with either 'true' or 'false'
  set Dummy generate output = true
end


subsection Eps output parameters
  # Angle of the viewing position against the vertical axis
  set Azimut angle                        = 60

  # Name of a color function used to colorize mesh lines and/or cell
  # interiors
  set Color function                      = default

  # Whether the interior of cells shall be shaded
  set Color shading of interior of cells  = true

  # Whether the mesh lines, or only the surface should be drawn
  set Draw mesh lines                     = true

  # Whether only the mesh lines, or also the interior of cells should be
  # plotted. If this flag is false, then one can see through the mesh
  set Fill interior of cells              = true

  # Number of the input vector that is to be used to generate color
  # information
  set Index of vector for color           = 0

  # Number of the input vector that is to be used to generate height
  # information
  set Index of vector for height          = 0

  # The width in which the postscript renderer is to plot lines
  set Line widths in eps units            = 0.5

  # Whether width or height should be scaled to match the given size
  set Scale to width or height            = width

  # Scaling for the z-direction relative to the scaling used in x- and
  # y-directions
  set Scaling for z-axis                  = 1

  # The size (width or height) to which the eps output file is to be scaled
  set Size (width or height) in eps units = 300

  # Angle of the viewing direction against the y-axis
  set Turn angle                          = 30
end

subsection Povray output parameters
  # Whether camera and lightling information should be put into an external
  # file "data.inc" or into the POVRAY input file
  set Include external file = true

  # Whether POVRAY should use bicubic patches
  set Use bicubic patches   = false

  # A flag indicating whether POVRAY should use smoothed triangles instead of
  # the usual ones
  set Use smooth triangles  = false
end


subsection UCD output parameters
  # A flag indicating whether a comment should be written to the beginning of
  # the output file indicating date and time of creation as well as the
  # creating program
  set Write preamble = true
end
</pre>

<p>
That's a lot of output for such a little program, but then that's also a lot of
output formats that deal.II supports. You will realize that the output consists
of first entries in the top-level section (sorted alphabetically), then a
sorted list of subsections. Within these are the dummy entries and sections we
have added in the <code>declare_parameters()</code> function, along with their
default values and documentations.
