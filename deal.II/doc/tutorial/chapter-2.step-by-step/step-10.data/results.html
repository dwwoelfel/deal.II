The program performs two tasks, the first being to generate a
visualization of the mapped domain, the second to compute pi by the
two methods described. Let us first take a look at the generated
graphics. They are generated in Gnuplot format, and can be viewed with
the commands
<pre>
set data style lines
set size 0.721, 1
set nokey
plot [-1:1][-1:1] "ball0_mapping_q1.dat"
</pre>
or using one of the other filenames. The second line makes sure that
the aspect ratio of the generated output is actually 1:1, i.e. a
circle is drawn as a circle on your screen, rather than as an
ellipse. The third line switches off the key in the graphic, as that
will only print information (the filename) which is not that important
right now.

The following table shows the triangulated computational domain for
Q1, Q2, and Q3 mappings, for the original coarse grid (left), and a
once uniformly refined grid (right). If your browser does not display
these pictures in acceptable quality, view them one by one.

These pictures show the obvious advantage of higher order mappings:
they approximate the true boundary quite well also on rather coarse
meshes. To demonstrate this a little further, the following table
shows the upper right quarter of the circle of the coarse mesh, and
with dashed lines the exact circle:
<table "width=80%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="step-10.data/quarter-q1.jpg" alt="Q1 mapping, coarse grid" height="300">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="step-10.data/quarter-q2.jpg" alt="Q2 mapping, coarse grid" height="300">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="step-10.data/quarter-q3.jpg" alt="Q3 mapping, coarse grid" height="300">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Obviously the quadratic mapping approximates the boundary quite well,
while for the cubic mapping the difference between approximated domain
and true one is hardly visible already for the coarse grid. You can
also see that the mapping only changes something at the outer
boundaries of the triangulation. In the interior, all lines are still
represented by linear functions, resulting in additional computations
only on cells at the boundary. Higher order mappings are therefore
usually not noticably slower than lower order ones, because the
additional computations are only performed on a small subset of all
cells.

The second purpose of the program was to compute the value of pi to
good accuracy. This is the output of this part of the program:

<p>
One of the immediate observations from the output is that in all cases
the values converge quickly to the true value of
pi=3.141592653589793238462643. Note that for the Q<sub>4</sub> mapping, the last
number is correct to 13 digits in both computations, which is already
quite a lot. However, also note that for the Q<sub>1</sub> mapping, even on the
finest grid the accuracy is significantly worse than on the coarse
grid for a Q<sub>4</sub> mapping!
</p>

<p>
The last column of the output shows the convergence order, in powers
of the mesh width <it>h</it>. In the introduction, we had stated that
the convergence order for a <it>Q<sub>p</sub></it> mapping should be
<it>h<sup>p+1</sup></it>. However, in the example shown, the Q<sub>2</sub> and Q<sub>4</sub>
mappings show a convergence order of <it>h<sup>p+2</sup></it>! This at
first surprising fact is readily explained by the particular boundary
we have chosen in this example. In fact, the circle is described by the function
<it>sqrt(1-x<sup>2</sup>)</it>, which has the series expansion 
<it>1-x<sup>2</sup>/2-x<sup>4</sup>/8-x<sup>6</sup>/16+...</it>
around <it>x=0</it>. Thus, for the quadratic mapping where the
truncation error of the quadratic approximation should be cubic, there
is no such term but only a quartic one, which raises the convergence
order to 4, instead of 3. The same happens for the Q<sub>4</sub> mapping.
