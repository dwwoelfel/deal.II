<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This is a rather short example which only shows some aspects of using
higher order mappings. By <it>mapping</it> we mean the transformation
between the unit cell (i.e. the unit line, square, or cube) to the
cells in real space. In all the previous examples, we have implicitly
used linear or d-linear mappings; you will not have noticed this at
all, since this is what happens if you do not do anything
special. However, if your domain has curved boundaries, there are
cases where the piecewise linear approximation of the boundary
(i.e. by straight line segments) is not sufficient, and you want that
your computational domain is an approximation to the real domain using
curved boundaries as well. If the boundary approximation uses
piecewise quadratic parabolas to approximate the true boundary, then
we say that this is a quadratic or <em>Q<sub>2</sub></em> approximation. If we
use piecewise graphs of cubic polynomials, then this is a <em>Q<sub>3</sub></em>
approximation, and so on.
</p>

<p>
For some differential equations, it is known that piecewise linear
approximations of the boundary, i.e. Q<sub>1</sub> mappings, are not
sufficient if the boundary of the domain is curved. Examples are the
biharmonic equation using C<sup>1</sup> elements, or the Euler
equation on domains with curved reflective boundaries. In these cases,
it is necessary to compute the integrals using a higher order
mapping. The reason, of course, is that if we do not use a higher
order mapping, the order of approximation of the boundary dominates
the order of convergence of the entire numerical scheme, irrespective
of the order of convergence of the discretization in the interior of
the domain.
</p>

<p>
Rather than demonstrating the use of higher order mappings with one of
these more complicated examples, we do only a brief computation:
calculating the value of pi=3.141592653589793238462643... by two
different methods.
</p>

<p>
The first method uses a triangulated approximation of the circle with
unit radius and integrates the unit function over it. Of course, if
the domain were the exact unit circle, then the area would be pi, but
since we only use an approximation by piecewise polynomial segments,
the value of the area is not exactly pi. However, it is known that as
we refine the triangulation, a Q<sub>p</sub> mapping approximates the boundary
with an order <it>h<sup>p+1</sup></it>, where <it>h</it> is the mesh
width. We will check the values of the computed area of the circle and
their convergence towards pi under mesh refinement for different
mappings. We will also find a convergence behavior that is surprising
at first, but has a good explanation.
</p>

<p>
The second method works similarly, but this time does not use the area
of the triangulated unit circle, but rather its perimeter. Pi is then
approximated by half of the perimeter, as the radius is equal to one.
