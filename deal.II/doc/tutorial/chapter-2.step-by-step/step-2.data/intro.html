<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
After we have created a grid in the previous example, we now show how
we can define degree of freedom on this mesh. For this example, we
will use the lowest order (Q1) finite elements, for which the degrees
of freedom are associated with the vertices of the mesh. Later
examples will show higher order elements where degrees of freedom are
not necessarily associated with nodes any more, but can be associated
with edges, faces, or cells.

Defining degrees of freedom ("DoF"s in short) on a mesh is a rather
simple task, since the library does all the work for you. However, for
some algorithms, especially for some linear solvers, it is
advantageous to have the degrees of freedom numbered in a certain
sense, and we will use the algorithm of Cuthill and McKee to do
so. The results are written to a file and visualized using GNUPLOT.
