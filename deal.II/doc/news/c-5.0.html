<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, parallel PETSc matrices only took the sizes of the
       matrix and the number of rows to be stored locally as arguments. They
       chose the partitioning of columns to be the same as that for the
       rows. However, this does not work for non-quadratic parallel matrices,
       and leads to very hard to find errors. Therefore, all constructors and
       reinit functions of the parallel sparse matrix classes now take an
       additional argument indicating the partitioning of columns of the matrix.

       </p>
</ol>



<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: None of the formulas in the step-8 tutorial program web
       page were visible. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/29)
       </p>

</ol>


<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: A class <code class="class">PointerComparison</code> for comparing
       pointers that may or may not be of the same type.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The <code
       class="class">ParameterHandler</code> class contained a remnant from
       back in 1997 when it was modeled after a similar class in DiffPack: it
       had a <code>status</code> flag that one could obtain via the <code
       class="member">ok</code> function. It was never really used for
       anything, and has thus finally been removed. The <code
       class="member">ok</code> is consequently gone as well.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: An object of the new <code
       class="class">ConditionalOStream</code> class allows to print
       to an output stream depending on a condition, which is active
       or not. This is particular useful for parallel computations
       when only one process should print to standard output, while in all
       other processes we simply want output suppressed.
       <br>

       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: A class <code class="class">PreconditionLU</code> which
       provides a wrapper to the complete LU decomposition
       preconditioner of PETSc. Furthermore a class 
       <code class="class">SolverPreOnly</code> was implemented. It
       is a wrapper for the PETSc solver type KSPPREONLY, which
       only applies the preconditioner. In conjunction with
       <code class="class">PreconditionLU</code> this provides a
       simple direct solver, which could be used for small to medium
       sized problems on a single processor machine.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2004/07/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="member">VectorTools::point_difference</code>
       used to use an algorithm to find the cell the given point is in that
       was linear in the total number of active cells. It has been rewritten
       to use
       <code class="member">GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point</code>
       which is only logarithmic in its complexity.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Block matrix iterators could get into all kind of interesting
       (and invalid) states when some of the blocks had empty rows. In this
       common case, we would frequently skip elements when looping over the
       elements of a block matrix. These cases should now be fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: Block matrix iterators used to have a function
       <code class="member">it-&gt;index()</code> that returned something like
       the position within a row. However, this was fragile, and has been
       removed. If you want an ordering of elements within a row, use the
       <code class="member">operator &lt;</code> to compare iterators.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code
       class="class">PETScWrappers::SolverGMRES::AdditionalData</code>
       class now takes an additional flag indicating the use of left
       or right preconditioning.
       <br> 
       (RH 2004/06/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code class="class">SparseDirectMA27</code> class can now
       handle float as well as double input matrices and vectors.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">SparseMatrix::vmult</code>-type functions
       <code>vmult</code>, <code>Tvmult</code>, <code>vmult_add</code>, and
       <code>Tvmult_add</code> take two different template arguments for input
       and output vectors, but were only instantiated in case the arguments
       were the same, and could also not be compiled if they weren't. Both
       problems are now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code class="class">CompressedSparsityPattern</code>
       class used one of the C++ standard containers to store the column
       indices of nonzero entries in a sparse matrix. This proved to be
       inefficient since it requires the allocation of 20 bytes each time an
       element was added, which for large matrices can be millions of
       times. The new storage format uses a more compact data structure, and a
       cache that requires memory allocation only every 8 additions, on
       average. This should significantly reduce the total amount of memory
       required as well as memory fragmentation. It also cuts run-time for
       element addition by more than half.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code
       class="member">CompressedSparsityPattern::max_entries_per_row()</code>
       ignored the first row and thus sometimes returned a value that was too
       low. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code class="member">BlockSparseMatrix::clear()</code> did not
       do what it was supposed to do: it emptied the individual blocks and
       removed them, but it still kept the number of blocks
       unchanged. Subsequent accesses to these blocks, or to their information
       yielded segmentation faults.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Block matrices and vectors have been factored into abstract base
       classes and concrete implementation classes. While the previous classes
       still exist in all their functionality, this allowed us to now also
       have block matrices and vectors for PETSc sequential and parallel
       objects.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Vector and block vector classes had a commented out template
       constructor constructing such a vector from a vector object with a
       different template argument, for example constructing a <code
       class="class">Vector&lt;double&gt;</code> from a <code
       class="class">Vector&lt;float&gt;</code>. This constructor has been
       commented out a long time ago due to a compiler bug in which the
       <code>explicit</code> keyword on template constructors was ignored, a
       fact that is dangerous since it may lead the compiler to generate
       temporaries without our ado. This bug is now detected during
       configuration time of the library, and these constructors are available
       whenever the compiler does not contain this bug.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In analogy to the PETSc vector classes, the PETSc matrix classes
       now also have member functions <code class="member">local_range</code>,
       <code class="member">in_local_range</code>, and <code
       class="member">local_size</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Parallel PETSc matrix and vector classes now have member functions
       <code class="member">get_mpi_communicator</code> that returns the MPI
       communicator object these objects operate on.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The PETSc linear solver classes now take a constant, rather
       than a nonconstant reference to the MPI communicator to be used. This
       prevents some unnecessary compiler problems in conjunction with the new
       <code class="member">get_mpi_communicator</code> function.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Parallel and sequential PETSc sparse matrix classes can now be
       initialized (via either constructor or reinit functions) with a
       compressed sparsity pattern object, allowing for more efficient
       preallocation of nonzero entries.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: The <code class="member">MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       that works on block matrices and vectors is now templatized over the
       number type, i.e. it also works for float matrices and vectors.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code class="member">FEValuesBase::get_cell</code>
       function returns the current cell, i.e. the latest cell the
       <code class="class">FEValues</code> object was reinited with.
       <br> 
       (RH 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">MatrixTools::local_apply_boundary_values</code> function
       used to set the diagonal entries of boundary nodes to one. This is a
       really bad choice, and the algorithm we use now is much better. There
       are still a few problems when using this function for matrices that
       will be solved as a Schur complement; there is nothing we can do in
       that function in these cases, since we are lacking fundamental pieces
       of information, but the cases where this applies and the strategies to
       work with this problem anyway are now well documented in the
       documentation of the <code class="class">MatrixTools</code> class.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code class="member">GridGenerator::cylinder_shell</code>
       function generated cells were all inside-out, i.e. had negative
       Jacobians. In usual finite element computations this simply leads to
       all components of the linear system being negated, so it is not
       harmful. It is fixed now anyway.
