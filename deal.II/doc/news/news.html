      <dt>
          <strong>2006/10/30: step-21 is finished</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Step-21 demonstrates the time dependent flow of a multiphase fluid
	  through a porous medium. It is an extension of step-20, using a mixed
	  formulation and block solvers.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2006/10/03: step-23/24 are finished</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The step-23 and step-24 tutorial programs have been added,
	  demonstrating how to solve the time dependent wave equation.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2006/2/12: step-20 is finished</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The new step-20 tutorial program shows how to use Raviart-Thomas
	  elements to solve a mixed formulation of the Laplace equation. It
	  also demonstrates the use of block matrices and vectors, and how they
	  can be used to define more complex solvers and preconditioners
	  working on the Schur complement.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2006/1/3-5: First User Workshop</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          After 8 years of existence, it was time to have the first user
	  meeting. During a 3-day workshop held in Heidelberg, topics of
	  software development, use of deal.II for applications, and future
	  directions were discussed by about a dozen developers and users.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2005/12/20: hp functionality merged</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          After the code had been developed and maintained on a branch for 3
	  years by Oliver Kayser-Herold and Wolfgang Bangerth, it has now been
	  merged into the main development, and will be available for the next
	  release.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong style="color:red">2005/09/17: Version 5.2 released</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Version 5.2.0 was released today!
          A complete and long list of changes between
	  versions 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 can be found <a
	  href="5.1.0-vs-5.2.0.html" target="body">here</a>.

      <dt>
          <strong>2005/09/09: Two more tutorial programs</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Two more tutorial programs, step-18 and step-19, are now
	  available. step-18 shows how to solve time-dependent but quasi-static
	  elasticity programs in parallel. step-19 demonstrates some data
	  handling and parameter file techniques.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2005/03/29: <acronym>deal.II</acronym> now has a Wiki</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Hosted by Luca Heltai, there is now a <a
          href="http://www-dimat.unipv.it/heltai/wikideal/index.php/Main_Page"
          target="_top"><acronym>deal.II</acronym> Wiki</a>. Users of
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> are encouraged to visit it, and,
          as is usual with wikis, edit pages freely and post their
          experiences and code snippets they want others to know about.

      <dt>
          <strong>2005/03/07: Function parser library integrated</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Luca Heltai has contributed code that integrates a third
          party <a
          href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~warp/FunctionParser/">function
	  parser library</a>) that takes a string describing a
	  mathematical function, and returns an object that can be used in
	  all places where function objects are used in deal.II.

      <dt>
          <strong style="color:red">2004/12/24: Version 5.1 released</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Version 5.1.0 was released today!
          A complete and long list of changes between
	  versions 5.0.0 and 5.1.0 can be found <a

      <dt>
          <strong>2004/10/21: Q<sub>r</sub> elements of arbitrary order now
          support hanging node constraints also in 3d</strong>
      </dt>
      
      <dd>
          Lagrange elements previously had hanging node constraint matrices
          hard coded in 3d, which were only available for r=1,2. Thanks to
          code written by Oliver Kayser-Herold, this information is now
          computed on-the-fly, which allows the use of Lagrange elements of
          arbitrary order also in 3d on meshes with hanging nodes.

          as well as to the METIS library for domain partitioning.
