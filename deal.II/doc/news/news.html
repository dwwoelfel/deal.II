          <strong>2001/09/24: Eulerian mapping</strong> 
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Michael Stadler has kindly provided an implementation of
          Eulerian mappings, i.e. a mapping between unit cell and real
          space that depends on a given vector field.

          <strong>2001/07/06: Compaq's cxx compiler supported</strong> 
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The present development version now also supports
          compilation by Compaq's cxx compiler. See the <a
          href="../readme.html#prerequisites" target="body">ReadMe</a>
          file for more information on using this compiler.

          The present development version of the library is now fixed
          so that it can also be compiled by

          <strong>2001/03/06: Support for arbitrary mappings</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The finite element classes have been redesigned from scratch
          to allow for arbitrary mappings, as well as for elements
          that depend on the actual cell shape, such as edge
          elements. Presently, we have continuous and discontinous
          Lagrange elements of arbitrary order implemented, as well as
          polynomial mappings between unit and real cell of arbitrary
          order. There is also a cubic C<sup>1</sup> mapping
          implemented.

          The <a href="http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL" 
          target="_top">Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL)</a> is a
          library that, among much other functionality, offers some
          sparse direct solvers. We have added support for an
          interface to these solvers to the library.
          (See the <a href="../readme.html#external-libs" target="body">ReadMe</a>
          file for more information on installation of HSL

          <strong>Changes between version 3.1 and the

      <dd>
	  After the branch for version 3.1 has been made on December
	  19th, 2000, there have already been a number of changes to the
	  main branch, i.e. changes that are not in version 3.1 but
	  will be in future releases. A complete list can be found

      <dd>
          After a long testing phase, we today released version 3.1 of
	  the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library.
	  There are many changes between version 3.0 and release
	  3.1. A complete list of these changes can be found

          scoping</strong>  
      </dt>
      <dd>
          All identifiers that the C++ standard (see
          <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/dec96pub/"
          target="_top">this page</a> for the public draft -- the
          standard itself is not available online for copyright reasons)
          mandates to be in namespace <code>std::</code> are correctly
          prefixed by the namespace name. While previous gcc compilers
          accepted these names also without the prefix, gcc 3.0 will
          require them, as do some commercial compilers.

          <strong>2000/11/27: Memory consumption monitoring</strong>

      <dd>
          Almost all classes in the library that store significant
          amounts of data now have a function 
	  <code class="member">memory_consumption</code> that returns an
          estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
	  class. These functions may be used to track down where memory
          bottlenecks are located.

          There is now a

	  is in fact an article in the proceeding of the IMACS

          Our API documentation is now generated by
