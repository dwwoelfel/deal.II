          <strong>2000/11/27: Memory consumption monitoring</strong> 
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Almost all classes in the library that store significant
          amounts of data now have a function 
	  <code class="member">memory_consumption</code> that returns an
          estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
	  class. These functions may be used to track down where memory
          bottlenecks are located.
