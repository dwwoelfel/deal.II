          <strong>2004/04/12: New example program for PETSc classes and
          parallel computing</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The step-17 example program shows how to use the new PETSc wrapper
          classes, and how to do large-scale computations with up to many
          millions of unknowns on a cluster of computers. This program shows
          that deal.II is well-suited for truly massive parallel
          computations.

      <dt>
          <strong>2004/03/08: Interfaces to PETSc and METIS</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          In order to support parallel computations, we now have interfaces to
          both the PETSc library for sequential and parallel linear algebra,
          as well as to the METIS library for domain partitioning.

      <dt>
          <strong>2004/03/08: MIPSpro compiler version 7.41 supported</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II now also supports compilation on SGIs by the MIPSpro
          compiler version 7.41.

      <dt>
          <strong>2003/08/19: Dependency generation accelerated</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The script that generates dependency information between
          sources and headers for Makefiles has been rewritten in C++,
          after the old perl script became too slow with the growth of
          the project. The new script is 2-5 times faster than the old one.

          <strong>2003/04/30: New report on Nedelec elements</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The next major version of the library will have support for
          Nedelec elements for H-curl approximations of, for example,
          the Maxwell equations. They were jointly implemented by
          Wolfgang Bangerth and Anna Schneebeli of the University of
          Basel, Switzerland, who has also contributed a
	  <a href="../reports/nedelec/main.html" target="body">report on the
          derivation and use of these elements</a>. It is available from the

      <dd>
          Since today, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has now more than 200,000
          lines of code. The rate of growth continues to be close to

          <strong>2003/02/06: A new multithreading scheme</strong> 
      </dt>
      <dd>
          A new multithreading scheme has been put into place; it has
          essentially the same functionality as the previous one, but
          is simpler and more intuitive to use. It also allows to call
          functions on a new thread that return values, and later
          retrieve the returned value when the thread has finished. Some
	  documentation of the scheme can be found
	  <a href="../reports/new-threads/index.html" target="body">on this
	  page</a>.

      <dt>
          <strong>2002/11/27: Modified Incomplete Cholesky decomposition</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          There is now a Modified Incomplete Cholesky (MIC) decomposition in
	  deal.II, which has been kindly contributed by
	  <a href="mailto:cheffo@riflexo.com">Stephen Kolaroff</a>.

          <strong>2002/10/14: Red Hat's gcc 2.96 supported</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II can now also be built with Red Hat's gcc 2.96 version. This
	  should make it easier for users of Red Hat 7.x distributions, since
	  they will no longer have to up- or downgrade their
	  compilers. However, some problems remain; for more information, refer
	  to the <a href="../faq.html" target="body">Frequently Asked
	  Questions</a> section.

      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II also runs on 64-bit systems without changes, as
          tests on a Sparc machine with Solaris 9 in 64-bit mode have
          shown. We also have reports of people running deal.II on
          IA64 systems.

          <strong>2002/06/17: New report on assembling matrices</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          There is now
	  <a href="../reports/assemble/index.html" target="body">a new report
          on assembling matrices</a> available from the 
	  <a href="../documentation.html" target="body">documentation
          page</a>. The main focus is assembling of matrices for
          vector-valued problems, where shape functions are
          vector-valued, and may have only one or more non-zero vector
          components.

      <dt>
          <strong>2002/06/10: Supporting framework for vector-valued
          finite elements committed</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> supports vector-valued finite
          elements for a long time, but only by composing them of
          scalar elements. This excluded Nedelec or Raviart-Thomas
          type elements, for which every shape function is
          vector-valued and non-zero in all components. Support for
          such elements is now available, and will be part of the next
          version.

      </dt>
      <dd>
          <code>aclocal.m4</code> has been changed to detect the Intel ECC
          compiler for Itanium systems.  The ECC compiler can produce
          optimized code for Intel's new IA-64 architecture.

          <strong>2002/05/05: New example program demonstrating
          duality based error estimators</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The step-14 example program in the tutorial demonstrates the
          use of duality based error estimation strategies which have
          been the focus of the Heidelberg group (from which the main
          authors come) for the last years. Some more strategies for
          modular and extensible programming are also discussed.

          <strong>2002/04/30: Multi-threading support using POSIX</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          In all previous versions, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> used
          the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html"
	  target="_top">ACE (Adaptive Communications Environment)</a>
	  library to support cross-platform threading
          facilities. While this is still supported, the default way
          is now to use the POSIX threading functions that are
          available on many systems.

          Benjamin Shelton Kirk contributed binary
          <a href="http://www.amtec.com">Tecplot</a> support.

          We checked all example and test programs as well as a number of
          large applications against the memory checker
          <code>purify</code>. Only three memory leaks were found and
          fixed. No invalid memory accesses were found. We believe

          to allow for arbitrary mappings, as well as for elements
          that depend on the actual cell shape, such as edge
