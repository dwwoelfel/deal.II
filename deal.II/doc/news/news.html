          <strong>2005/03/29: <acronym>deal.II</acronym> now has a Wiki</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Hosted by Luca Heltai, there is now a <a
          href="http://www-dimat.unipv.it/heltai/wikideal/index.php/Main_Page"
          target="_top"><acronym>deal.II</acronym> Wiki</a>. Users of
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> are encouraged to visit it, and,
          as is usual with wikis, edit pages freely and post their
          experiences and code snippets they want others to know about.

          <strong>2005/03/07: Function parser library integrated</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Luca Heltai has contributed code that integrates a third
          party <a
          href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~warp/FunctionParser/">function
	  parser library</a>) that takes a string describing a
	  mathematical function, and returns an object that can be used in
	  all places where function objects are used in deal.II.

          <strong style="color:red">2004/12/24: Version 5.1 released</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Version 5.1.0 was released today!
          A complete and long list of changes between

          <strong>2004/10/21: Q<sub>r</sub> elements of arbitrary order now
          support hanging node constraints also in 3d</strong>
      </dt>
      
      <dd>
          Lagrange elements previously had hanging node constraint matrices
          hard coded in 3d, which were only available for r=1,2. Thanks to
          code written by Oliver Kayser-Herold, this information is now
          computed on-the-fly, which allows the use of Lagrange elements of
          arbitrary order also in 3d on meshes with hanging nodes.
