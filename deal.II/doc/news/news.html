          <strong>2002/10/14: Red Hat's gcc 2.96 supported</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II can now also be built with Red Hat's gcc 2.96 version. This
	  should make it easier for users of Red Hat 7.x distributions, since
	  they will no longer have to up- or downgrade their
	  compilers. However, some problems remain; for more information, refer
	  to the <a href="../faq.html" target="body">Frequently Asked
	  Questions</a> section.

      <dd>
          deal.II also runs on 64-bit systems without changes, as
          tests on a Sparc machine with Solaris 9 in 64-bit mode have
          shown. We also have reports of people running deal.II on
          IA64 systems.

          There is now
	  <a href="../reports/assemble/index.html" target="body">a new report
          on assembling matrices</a> available from the 
	  <a href="../documentation.html" target="body">documentation
          page</a>. The main focus is assembling of matrices for
          vector-valued problems, where shape functions are
          vector-valued, and may have only one or more non-zero vector
          components.

          finite elements committed</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> supports vector-valued finite
          elements for a long time, but only by composing them of
          scalar elements. This excludes Nedelec or Raviart-Thomas
          type elements, for which every shape function is
          vector-valued and non-zero in all components. Support for
          such elements is now available, and will be part of the next
          version.

          The step-14 example program in the tutorial demonstrates the
          use of duality based error estimation strategies which have
          been the focus of the Heidelberg group (from which the main

          The finite element classes have been redesigned from scratch
          to allow for arbitrary mappings, as well as for elements
          that depend on the actual cell shape, such as edge
          elements. Presently, we have continuous and discontinous
          Lagrange elements of arbitrary order implemented, as well as
          polynomial mappings between unit and real cell of arbitrary
          order. There is also a cubic C<sup>1</sup> mapping
          implemented.
