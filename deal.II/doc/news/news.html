      <dd>
          Today, version 3.3 of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library
	  has been released. A complete list of changes between

      <dd>
          All <code>.cc</code> and <code>.h</code> files of
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> now sum up to more than 160.000(!)
          lines of code. <acronym>deal.II</acronym> continues to grow
          with a rate almost constant at 3000 lines of code per month.

      <dd>
          Guido Kanschat and Benjamin Shelton Kirk contributed output
          for OpenDX and Tecplot graphics formats, which are now
          supported along a long list of other graphics
          format. Switching output formats is possible at run time of
          applications.

      </dt>
      <dd>
          We checked all example and test programs as well as a number of
          large applications against the memory checker
          <code>purify</code>. Only three memory leaks were found and
          fixed. No invalid memory accesses were found. We believe
          that no major memory leaks exist in the library any more.

          After a long phase of implementation and testing, we today

          Michael Stadler has kindly provided an implementation of

          <strong>2001/03/06: Support for arbitrary mappings</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The finite element classes have been redesigned from scratch
          to allow for arbitrary mappings, as well as for elements
          that depend on the actual cell shape, such as edge
          elements. Presently, we have continuous and discontinous
          Lagrange elements of arbitrary order implemented, as well as
          polynomial mappings between unit and real cell of arbitrary
          order. There is also a cubic C<sup>1</sup> mapping
          implemented.

          target="_top">Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL)</a> is a
          library that, among much other functionality, offers some
          sparse direct solvers. We have added support for an
          interface to these solvers to the library.
          (See the <a href="../readme.html#external-libs" target="body">ReadMe</a>

          All identifiers that the C++ standard (see

          standard itself is not available online for copyright reasons)
          mandates to be in namespace <code>std::</code> are correctly
          prefixed by the namespace name. While previous gcc compilers
          accepted these names also without the prefix, gcc 3.0 will
          require them, as do some commercial compilers.

          Almost all classes in the library that store significant
          amounts of data now have a function 
	  <code class="member">memory_consumption</code> that returns an
          estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
