<h2>Changes after Version 4.0</h2>

<p>
This is the list of changes made after the release of 
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> version 4.0. It is subdivided into changes
made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>, 
<a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as
changes to the <a href="#general">general infrastructure,
documentation, etc</a>.

<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Moved and changed: The header file
  <tt>include/numerics/dof_renumbering.h</tt> has been moved to the
  directory <tt>include/dofs</tt>, where it logically
  belongs. Furthermore, the sorting parameter of the function <code
  class="class">DoFRenumbering</code>::<code
  class="member">component_wise</code> has changed its meaning. See
  the reference documentation for details.

  <li> <p> 
       New: The new <code class="member">FETools::get_fe_from_name</code>
       function can do the reverse of the <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::get_name</code> function: it
       takes a string and parses it to regenerate a finite element
       from it. Useful for parsing finite element names from input files.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/07/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code class="member">DataOut_DoFData::merge_patches</code>
       now takes a second parameter that indicates a shift for each
       vertex of the given patches to be merged. This is sometimes
       nice if one wants to generate "exploded" views of a collection
       of subdomains. It is also templatized on the first argument, so
       can merge in some other <code
       class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code> that create the same type
       of patches but are otherwise different.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code class="member">FETools::extrapolate</code>
       function operates on patches of cells, but didn't check whether
       the grid is at least refined once everywhere. If this was not
       the case, it would generate wrong results. It now checks for
       this, and if the grid has unrefined coarse grid cells, an
       exception is generated.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">FEFaceValuesBase</code> has a new
       function <code class="member">orientation</code> accessing a unique
       and consistent orientation for each face.
       <br> 
       (GK 2003/06/23)

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Embedding and restriction matrices for intergrid transfer are
       now computed in the constructor of most elements, rather than taken from
       precomputed and tabulated values. This removes restrictions on which
       elements are available since the old tables were only precomputed for
       certain polynomial degrees and are now available for all.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_interpolation_matrix</code>, with which they can
       compute interpolations between different finite elements. Most will use
       this to compute interpolations between finite elements of the same kind
       but different polynomial degrees. The <code
       class="member">FETools::get_interpolation_matrix</code> makes use of
       this function if it implements the desired interpolation, and falls back
       to the old algorithm if this is not the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_name</code>, which can be used to identify a finite
       element by its name.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Raviart-Thomas elements are now implemented in the <code
       class="class">FE_RaviartThomas</code> class.
       <br>
