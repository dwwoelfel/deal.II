<p>
This is the list of changes made after the release of 
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> version 4.0. It is subdivided into changes
made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>, 
<a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as
changes to the <a href="#general">general infrastructure,
documentation, etc</a>.

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Moved and changed: The header file
  <tt>include/numerics/dof_renumbering.h</tt> has been moved to the
  directory <tt>include/dofs</tt>, where it logically
  belongs. Furthermore, the sorting parameter of the function <code
  class="class">DoFRenumbering</code>::<code
  class="member">component_wise</code> has changed its meaning. See
  the reference documentation for details.

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> First steps to a migration of the documentation from
  <tt>kdoc</tt> to <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> have
  been done. It can be generated after installing <a
  href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> by calling <tt>make</tt>
  in <tt>doc/doxygen</tt> and using the preliminary link page <a
  href="../doxygen/index.html">index.html</a> in that directory.

<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Improved: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> now takes an
       additional parameter (defaulting to the empty string) that can be used
       to document the intent of a parameter. This string, together with the
       default value of an entry, is written to the output by the <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::print_parameters</code> function that
       can be used to generate a virginial parameter file, or one that contains
       the settings of all parameters used in a computation.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> previously
       returned a value indicating whether the just-declared entry didn't
       already existed and that the default value matches the given
       pattern. However, this value could only always be true since these two
       conditions were already guarded by assertions in the implementation at
       least in debug mode, so the return value was meaningless. The function
       has now no return type any more.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">depth_console</code>, <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code class="member">depth_file</code>, <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">log_execution_time</code> and <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">log_time_differences</code> return the previous value.
       <br>

       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p> New: The classes <code class="class">FullMatrix</code> and
  <code class="class">PreconditionBlockJacobi</code> have a <code
  class="class">const_iterator</code>.
  <br>
  (GK 2003/07/18)
  </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> New: The new <code class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">get_fe_from_name</code> function can do the
       reverse of the <code class="class">FiniteElement</code>::<code
       class="member">get_name</code> function: it takes a string and
       parses it to regenerate a finite element from it. Useful for
       parsing finite element names from input files.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/07/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code>::<code
       class="member">merge_patches</code> now takes a second
       parameter that indicates a shift for each vertex of the given
       patches to be merged. This is sometimes nice if one wants to
       generate "exploded" views of a collection of subdomains. It is
       also templatized on the first argument, so can merge in some
       other <code class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code> that create
       the same type of patches but are otherwise different.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">extrapolate</code> function operates on patches
       of cells, but didn't check whether the grid is at least refined
       once everywhere. If this was not the case, it would generate
       wrong results. It now checks for this, and if the grid has
       unrefined coarse grid cells, an exception is generated.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">FEFaceValuesBase</code> has a new
       function <code class="member">orientation</code> accessing a unique
       and consistent orientation for each face.
       <br> 
       (GK 2003/06/23)

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Embedding and restriction matrices for intergrid transfer are
       now computed in the constructor of most elements, rather than taken from
       precomputed and tabulated values. This removes restrictions on which
       elements are available since the old tables were only precomputed for
       certain polynomial degrees and are now available for all.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_interpolation_matrix</code>, with which they can
       compute interpolations between different finite elements. Most will use
       this to compute interpolations between finite elements of the same kind
       but different polynomial degrees. The <code
       class="member">FETools::get_interpolation_matrix</code> makes use of
       this function if it implements the desired interpolation, and falls back
       to the old algorithm if this is not the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_name</code>, which can be used to identify a finite
       element by its name.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Raviart-Thomas elements are now implemented in the <code
       class="class">FE_RaviartThomas</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
