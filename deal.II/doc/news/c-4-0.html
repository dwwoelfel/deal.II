<ol>
  <li> <p> Moved and changed: The header file
  <tt>include/numerics/dof_renumbering.h</tt> has been moved to the
  directory <tt>include/dofs</tt>, where it logically
  belongs. Furthermore, the sorting parameter of the function <code
  class="class">DoFRenumbering</code>::<code
  class="member">component_wise</code> has changed its meaning. See
  the reference documentation for details.

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> When building with both sparse direct solver MA27 and the
       TECPLOT libraries, the <code>detached_ma27</code> would not
       link properly. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> The script that builds the dependency lists for Makefiles
       has been rewritten in C++, since the previous perl script
       became just too slow after the addition of parts of
       BOOST. Using the old perl script should still work, although it
       simply forwards to the new program. In order to use the new
       one, simply replace the line
       <code><pre>
         $(PERL) $D/common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl ...
       </pre></code>
       by
       <code><pre>
         $D/common/scripts/make_dependencies ...
       </pre></code>
       i.e. call the program directly without the perl interpreter and
       without the file extension for a perl program.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/08/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> First steps to a migration of the documentation from
       <tt>kdoc</tt> to <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> have
       been done. It can be generated after installing <a
       href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> by calling <tt>make</tt>
       in <tt>doc/doxygen</tt> and using the preliminary link page <a
       href="../doxygen/index.html">index.html</a> in that directory.

<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Changed: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> function
       now allows to redeclare an entry that has already been
       declared. This can be used to override a default value
       previously set.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> function now takes an
       additional parameter (defaulting to the empty string) that can be used
       to document the intent of a parameter. This string, together with the
       default value of an entry, is written to the output by the <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::print_parameters</code> function that
       can be used to generate a virginial parameter file, or one that contains
       the settings of all parameters used in a computation.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> previously
       returned a value indicating whether the just-declared entry didn't
       already existed and that the default value matches the given
       pattern. However, this value could only always be true since these two
       conditions were already guarded by assertions in the implementation at
       least in debug mode, so the return value was meaningless. The function
       has now no return type any more.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">depth_console</code>, <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code class="member">depth_file</code>, <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">log_execution_time</code> and <code
       class="class">Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">log_time_differences</code> return the previous value.
       <br>

       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Changed: The <code class="class">SparseDirectMA27</code>
       class used to store a pointer to the sparsity pattern of the
       matrix. It now releases this as soon as it doesn't need it any
       more.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Some of the member matrix-vector functions of the
       <code class="class">BlockSparseMatrix</code> class that
       previously could only be used with arguments of type <code
       class="class">BlockVector</code> can now also be used with the
       usual <code class="class">Vector</code> class provided the
       block matrix has only one block row or column.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: <code class="class">FullMatrix</code>::<code
       class="member">copy_from</code> didn't compile when copying
       from a sparse matrix. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2002/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The classes <code class="class">FullMatrix</code> and
       <code class="class">PreconditionBlockJacobi</code> have a <code
       class="class">const_iterator</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/07/18)

<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">GridGenerator</code> has a new
       function <code class="member">subdivided_hyper_rectangle</code> 
       which generates a rectangle with given corner points and possibly 
       different numbers of subdivisions in different directions.
       Use it e.g., to generate a domain of 1*4 length units
       with square cells.
       <br> 
       (Joerg Weimar 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">GridOut</code> has a an improved
       functionality for <code class="member">write_eps</code> 
       to color the grid according to the refinement level.
       A corresponding option is included in 
       <code class="class">GridOutFlags::Eps<2></code>.
       <br> 
       (Joerg Weimar 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code class="class">TriaAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">point_inside</code> function is now also
       implemented in 3d.
       <br>
       (Joerg Weimar, WB 2002/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code class="class">TriaAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">recursively_set_material_id</code> function sets
       the material id of the present cell and of all its children,
       grandchildren, etc to the given value.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">get_fe_from_name</code> function can do the
       reverse of the <code class="class">FiniteElement</code>::<code
       class="member">get_name</code> function: it takes a string and
       parses it to regenerate a finite element from it. Useful for
       parsing finite element names from input files.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/07/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code>::<code
       class="member">merge_patches</code> now takes a second
       parameter that indicates a shift for each vertex of the given
       patches to be merged. This is sometimes nice if one wants to
       generate "exploded" views of a collection of subdomains. It is
       also templatized on the first argument, so can merge in some
       other <code class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code> that create
       the same type of patches but are otherwise different.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">extrapolate</code> function operates on patches
       of cells, but didn't check whether the grid is at least refined
       once everywhere. If this was not the case, it would generate
       wrong results. It now checks for this, and if the grid has
       unrefined coarse grid cells, an exception is generated.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">FEFaceValuesBase</code> has a new
       function <code class="member">orientation</code> accessing a unique
       and consistent orientation for each face.
       <br> 
       (GK 2003/06/23)

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Embedding and restriction matrices for intergrid transfer are
       now computed in the constructor of most elements, rather than taken from
       precomputed and tabulated values. This removes restrictions on which
       elements are available since the old tables were only precomputed for
       certain polynomial degrees and are now available for all.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_interpolation_matrix</code>, with which they can
       compute interpolations between different finite elements. Most will use
       this to compute interpolations between finite elements of the same kind
       but different polynomial degrees. The <code
       class="member">FETools::get_interpolation_matrix</code> makes use of
       this function if it implements the desired interpolation, and falls back
       to the old algorithm if this is not the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code
       class="member">get_name</code>, which can be used to identify a finite
       element by its name.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Raviart-Thomas elements are now implemented in the <code
       class="class">FE_RaviartThomas</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
