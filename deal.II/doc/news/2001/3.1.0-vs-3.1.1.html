<h2>Changes between versions 3.1 and 3.1.1</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       Removed: The explicite instantiations of <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix<long double></code> are removed as a
       prerelease of gcc3.0 fails to compile it. Despite of this
       SparseMatrix<long double></code> still can be used if the user
       includes <code>lac/include/lac/sparse_matrix.templates.h</code>
       into his source file and uses a different compiler, e.g. gcc
       2.95.2 or a future version of gcc3.0 (that will then hopefully
       fixed).
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: We now unconditionally include
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.templates.h</code>
       (which contains some inline functions for triangulation
       accessor classes) into 
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.h</code> to work
       around a problem with gcc3.0 which does not place a copy of
       these functions into the library. Previously we only included
       the file in optimized mode.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code class="class">GridReordering::Cell</code> has
       now a copy constructor to work around a bug in a gcc3.0
       snapshot.
       <br>
       (RH, WB 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: a missing <code>const</code> prevented the <code
       class="class">PreconditionSelector</code> class to be
       compiled.
       <br>
       (Roger Young, John Burnell 2001/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Updated: the scripts <code>config.sub</code> and
       <code>config.guess</code> were updated to their newest
       versions, since <code>./configure</code> did not run properly
       on all systems. They are needed to determine the host system
       type correctly.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: in the triangulation, the <code
       class="member">straight_boundary</code> variable, which is a
       reference, was assigned the address of a temporary object. It
       is unclear how this could have worked for three years, but it
       apparently did...
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the <code
       class="member">DoFTools::compute_intergrid_constraints</code>
       function took memory quadratic in the number of degrees of
       freedom. This is now reduced to linear behaviour, with a
       constant that depends on the number of levels by which the two
       grids differ.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>
