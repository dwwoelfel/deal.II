<h2>Changes between versions 3.1 and 3.1.1</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fix: in the triangulation, the <code
       class="member">straight_boundary</code> variable, which is a
       reference, was assigned the address of a temporary object. It
       is unclear how this could have worked for three years, but it
       apparently did...
       <br>

       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the <code
       class="member">DoFTools::compute_intergrid_constraints</code>
       function took memory quadratic in the number of degrees of
       freedom. This is now reduced to linear behaviour, with a
       constant that depends on the number of levels by which the two
       grids differ.
