<h2>Changes after Version 4.0</h2>

<p>
This is the list of changes made after the release of 
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> version 4.0. It is subdivided into changes
made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>, 
<a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as
changes to the <a href="#general">general infrastructure,
documentation, etc</a>.

contributor's names are abbreviated by WB (Wolfgang Bangerth), GK
(Guido Kanschat), RH (Ralf Hartmann).

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Changed: The <code class="class">FiniteElement</code> classes had a
       function <code class="member">restrict</code> that returns the
       restriction matrix from children to the mother cell. Unfortunately,
       <code>restrict</code> has become a keyword in recent standards of the C
       language, and some C++ compilers have picked this up. The function has
       therefore been renamed <code
       class="member">get_restriction_matrix</code>, which also better
       reflects what it is actually doing. To keep consistent, we have also
       rename the corresponding function <code
       class="member">prolongate</code> to <code
       class="member">get_prolongation_matrix</code>. 
       <br>

       </p>

</ol>


<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> New: There are now switches <code>--with-petsc</code> and
       <code>--with-petsc-arch</code> to configure path and architecture of an
       existing PETSc installation. If these switches are not used, then
       environment variables are searched for this information.
       <br>

<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> New: The <code class="class">Vector</code> and <code
       class="class">BlockVector</code> classes now have member functions
       <code class="member">is_non_negative</code> that check whether a vector
       has no negative entries.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code
       class="class">SolverMinRes</code> class had a nasty bug where we were
       inadvertantly copying vectors; this could also have led to a memory
       corruption bug. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There is now a function <code
       class="class">FullMatrix::add_scaled</code>. It replaces the old
       function <code class="class">FullMatrix::add</code> which did the same,
       but had a name that was incompatible with respective functions in the
       other matrix classes.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code
       class="class">Vector</code> class now has operators to compare for
       equality and inequality.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code
       class="member">SparseMatrix::operator()</code> generated an assertion
       failure if the requested entry in the matrix isn't there. This has been
       changed so that it actually throws an exception instead, also in
       optimized mode.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There is now a function <code
       class="member">SparseMatrix::frobenius_norm</code> that computes the
       Frobenius norm of a sparse matrix.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: In matrix-vector operations of the <code
       class="class">Full/SparseMatrix</code> classes, source and destination
       cannot be the same. We now also check that this is indeed the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/01/26)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Changed: The classes <code class="class">DataOut*</code> and <code
       class="class">KellyErrorEstimator</code> have been generalized to take
       more and different vector types as input parameters. In particular,
       they now take normal and block vectors over doubles and floats, as well
       as PETSc vectors if PETSc support is detected during configuration of
       the library.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The template parameter of the functions in the <code
       class="class">GridRefinement</code> class have been changed. Where they
       previously denoted the type over which the <code
       class="class">Vector</code> class is to be templated, they now mean the
       actual vector class. Thus, they can be any other template class as long
       as there are suitable operations defined over them. In addition,
       the documentation stated that they must be vectors of floats; this
       hasn't been true any more for quite a while already, and is duly
       removed from the documentation.
       <br>
