<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: Everything that is part of the deal.II library has
       been moved into a namespace <code>dealii</code>. To allow your
       code to compile, you will have to either put a <code>using
       namespace dealii;</code> declaration at the top of each file,
       or qualify each deal.II class and function explicitly with
       <code>dealii::</code> namespace access.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/10/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Indices, such as vertex indices, are usually represented by
       unsigned integers in deal.II. One place where we didn't do this was in
       the <code>CellData</code> structure that can be used to describe cells
       when building a triangulation. This has now been rectified. 
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/09/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Lower dimensional objects have been removed from the
       hierachical structure of levels in <code
       class="class">TriaLevel</code>. Faces, i.e. lines in 2D and
       lines and quads in 3D, have no associated level
       anymore. Therefore, the level argument of some iterator
       functions have been removed. The affected functions are <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>:: <code
       class="member">begin_raw_face</code>, <code
       class="member">begin_face</code>, <code
       class="member">begin_active_face</code> and all <code
       class="member">last_*_face</code> or <code
       class="member">end_*_face</code> functions, no matter whether
       raw, used or active. Also effected are the direct iterator
       functions which are related to faces like <code
       class="member">begin_line</code> in 2D and 3D or <code
       class="member">begin_quad</code> in 3D. Again, the same applies
       to <code class="member">last_*</code> and <code
       class="member">end_*</code>.
       <br>
       The respective functions in <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code>, <code
       class="class">hp::DoFHandler</code> and <code
       class="class">MGDoFHandler</code> have been changed
       accordingly.
       <br>
       Nested loops with an outer loop over all levels and an inner
       loop over all faces on that level have to be changed to a
       single loop over all faces. In most cases, the necessary
       changes should be internal to the library.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht, 2006/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: In order to facilitate the implementation of hp finite
       elements, the ordering of boundary DoFs returned by <code 
       class="member">DoFTools::map_dof_to_boundary_indices</code> has been
       changed. Fortunately, this is a rarely used function so that the effect
       should be limited to only a few programs.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">distribute_local_to_global</code> functions have
       been moved from the classes implementing accessors to arbitrary
       objects in the triangulation to the cell accessors, to
       facilitate the implementation of hp methods. That means
       that you can't call these functions for face or edge iterators
       any more, but only cells. Since this is what is usually
       desired, this should not be too severe a restriction.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The template argument of the <code
       class="class">InterGridMap</code> class has been changed. Code
       like e.g. <code
       class="class">InterGridMap&lt;DoFHandler,2&gt;</code> must be
       replaced by <code
       class="class">InterGridMap&lt;DoFHandler&lt;2&gt; &gt;</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>DoFObjectAccessor</code> and derived classes
       used to take only the space dimension and the dimension of the
       object they represented as template arguments. Now the later
       argument is replaced by the type of DoFHandler they correspond
       to. This may be <code>::DoFHandler</code> or
       <code>hp::DoFHandler</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/10, WB 2005/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: Support for gcc2.95 in particular, and all compilers that do
       not support the <code>std::ostringstream</code> class in general,
       has been removed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/02/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Several classes related to the storage of data in the
       Triangulation and DoFHandler classes have been moved into internal
       namespaces, and some have also been removed. Since these were not for
       use anywhere outside the library, it is unlikely that this poses
       problems to application programs. On the other hand, it moves common
       names like <code>Line</code> and <code>Quad</code> out of the global
       namespace.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, if <code>mg_dof_handler</code> was a
       multilevel DoF handler object, calling
       <code>DoFRenumbering::component_wise(mg_dof_handler)</code>)
       didn't quite do what was probably intended: it did an implicit
       cast of <code>mg_dof_handler</code> to its base class,
       <code>DoFHandler</code> and then renumbered the <em>global</em>
       degrees of freedom, but didn't touch the multilevel part. This
       has now been fixed: there is another function that takes a
       <code>MGDoFHandler</code> object and that renumbers the global
       part as well as all levels of the multigrid part. The change is
       incompatible since the previous call now leads to a different
       action; if you really want the old behavior back, cast the
       argument to the base class before the call, like so:
       <code>DoFRenumbering::component_wise(static_cast&lt;DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;&&gt;(mg_dof_handler))</code>)
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/12/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The internal numbering of faces, lines and vertices
       has been reimplemented. Now the numbering scheme uses a
       lexicographic ordering (with x running fastest) whereever
       possible. For more information on the new numbering scheme, see
       the <a
       href="http://ganymed.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/pipermail/dealii/2005/000827.html">announcement</a>
       on the mailing list.  <br> The ordering of vertices in <code
       class="class">CellData</code> given to the <code
       class="member">Triangulation::create_triangulation</code>
       function has been changed accordingly. For backward
       compatibility there is now a new <code
       class="member">Triangulation::create_triangulation_compatibility</code>
       function which takes <code class="class">CellData</code> in the
       old vertex ordering. However, as this function might not be
       supported forever users are advised to change their code to the
       new numbering scheme and to use the <code
       class="member">Triangulation::create_triangulation</code>
       function.  
       <br>

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p>New: a program <tt>reconfigure</tt> has been added to the
  deal.II main directory, which reruns <tt>configure</tt> with the sam
  command line arguments as last time.
  <br>
  (GK 2006/10/24)
  </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-21 tutorial programs is ready. It considers time
       dependent two-phase flow through a porous medium.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/10/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-23/step-24 tutorial programs have been added,
       discussing how to solve the wave equation.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/10/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: when building the library in parallel, using <code>make
        -jN</code> (most often with rather large values of <code>N</code>, for
	example 8), it could sometimes happen that the same file is compiled
	twice at exactly the same time. This leads to invalid object files and
	libraries that would contain illegal instructions. This is now fixed.
	<br>
	(WB 2006/08/09)
	</p> 

  <li> <p> Changed: The default number of subdivisions in the <code
       class="member">build_patches</code> functions of the DataOut classes is
       now part of the parameters read by <code
       class="member">parse_parameters</code>. This default value is used
       whenever patches with zero subdivisions are being built.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/06/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: a configuration parameter <tt>--with-boost</tt> has been
	introduced, allowing the selection of a previously installed boost
	library instead of the contibuted.
	<br>
	(GK 2006/03/23)
	</p> 

  <li> <p>New: The step-20 tutorial program was added. It shows how to use
       Raviart-Thomas elements to solve a mixed formulation of the Laplace
       equation. It also demonstrates the use of block matrices and vectors,
       and how they can be used to define more complex solvers and
       preconditioners working on the Schur complement.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Updated: The <code>deal.II/contrib/boost</code> library has
       been updated to boost version 1.33.1.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Documentation has been greatly enhanced, both in the
       API documentation as well as in the tutorial programs. In
       particular, the step-1 through step-8 tutorial programs have
       been overhauled and in many cases the documentation has been
       rewritten in large parts. The presentation of tutorial programs
       and reference manual should also be nicer and better readable
       in many cases.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, the UMFPACK code was linked into its own
       library, <code>liblac_umfpack.*</code>. Instead, it is now
       directly linked into the <code>liblac.*</code> libraries. This
       makes further linking simpler than before and also simplified
       the link process.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/01/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The order of quadrature points is now x fastest, z slowest, as
       well as the vertices of cells. Also, the nodes and subcells of patches
       in DataOutBase follow the same ordering. Output code could be simplified
       a lot, saving 900 lines of code.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Documentation of tutorial program is now run through
       Doxygen. This allows cross-referencing the tutorial programs to
       the API manual (and the other way round) and leads to a
       generally much nicer output. In particular, formulas embedded
       in the documentation of the programs are now properly displayed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The link to the manual now points directly to
       Doxygen's module list, and almost all classes are now grouped
       into modules that capture related functionality.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: If you do have a PETSc installation
       and have set the <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and
       <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> environment variables but do not wish
       <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to be configured for PETSc use, you
       should specify <code>--with-petsc=no</code> as a flag during
       configuration. 
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: In all directories, including those for tutorial
       programs, we generate a file called <code>Makefile.dep</code>
       that lists the dependencies of object files on source files,
       and that the <code>make</code> uses to determine which files to
       recompile. If the generation of this file failed (for example
       if <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> hadn't been set correctly), a
       number of very strange things would happen, among others the
       attempt to link an empty object file. This was almost
       impossible to figure out if you didn't know what was going
       on. This mechanism has now been robustified and should yield
       better error messages.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/11/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The dynamic libraries, which is the name of shared libs
       under Apples OSX, are now supported on these platforms and
       enabled by default. They should safe a lot of harddisk space.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2005/10/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <tt>Tecplot</tt> library (<tt>tecio.a</tt>) was
       detected but not added to <tt>LIBS</tt>. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <tt>configure</tt> will automatically detect a
       <tt>NetCDF</tt> installation, when its path is given by the
       <tt>NETCDF_DIR</tt> environment variable. The path of the
       <tt>NetCDF</tt> installation directory can also be specified
       through the <tt>--with-netcdf=/path/to/netcdf</tt> configure
       option.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The PETSc libraries have been relinked each time
       <tt>make</tt> was called. Now, the PETSc libraries will only be
       relinked if necessary.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/15)
       </p>

</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Extended: The <code>contract</code> function family contracts two
	    tensors. There is now a new version of this function, that contracts a
	    tensor of rank three with a second one of rank two over given indices
	    <tt>index1</tt> and <tt>index2</tt> of the first and second tensor,
	    respectively, resulting in a tensor of rank three.
	    <br>
		 (Tobias Leicht 2006/09/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The
       <code>DataOutBase::write_deal_II_intermediate</code> function
       did not check whether it can actually write to the stream
       given. It would therefore silently do nothing if the file could
       not be written to. This is now fixed: an exception is generated
       in that case, as for all the other output functions in that class.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: Stack backtraces in multithreaded mode were often
       very long and almost unreadable because the functions in
       namespace <code>Threads</code> that are used to set up new
       threads have long and awkward signatures. The output is now
       filtered to make these backtraces easier to read.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The second argument to <code>Utilities::int_to_string</code>
       can now be omitted, leading to a string that isn't zero padded at all.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: When there is still a <code>SmartPointer</code> object
       pointing to another object at the time it is destroyed, this would cause
       the program to be aborted. However, there are cases where this is not
       desirable, for example here:
       <pre>
       <code>
          void f() 
          {
	    Triangulation tria;
	    DoFHandler *dh = new DoFHandler(tria);
	    ...some function that throws an exception
          }
       </code>
       </pre>
       When the exception is thrown but not caught, the two local objects are
       destroyed in reverse order of their construction, i.e. first the pointer
       then the triangulation. However, only the pointer, not the
       <code>DoFHandler</code> pointed to is destroyed, triggering the abort in
       the triangulation since there is still the <code>DoFHandler</code>
       object pointing to it at the time of destruction of the
       triangulation. In such cases, one would not want to see the program
       aborted, since then one would never learn about the actual exception
       being thrown.
       <br>
       The behavior of the <code>Subscriptor</code> class as therefore been
       changed to not abort the program any more if an exception is being
       handled at the moment. Rather, only an error message is shown on
       <code>std::cerr</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>TableHandler::write_tex</code>
       accidentally took a parameter of type
       <code>std::ofstream</code> instead of <code>std::ostream</code>
       and could therefore only write to files, not to other kinds of
       streams. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/07/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code> offers several new
       functions, <code>is_inside_unit_cell</code> with an epsilon parameter to
       specify allowable offsets from the actual unit cell,
       <code>distance_to_unit_cell</code> returning the infinity norm of the
       distance of a given point to the unit cell, and
       <code>project_to_unit_cell</code> returning the projection of a point
       onto the unit cell. Also, a new member <code>vertex_to_face</code> allow
       to determine to which faces of a cell a vertex belongs. 
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2006/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code class="class">DataOutBase</code>::<code
       class="member">OutputFormat</code> has a new value <tt>none</tt>,
       writing no output at all. This way, the writing of output files can be
       controlled more easily from parameter files.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code class="class">VectorSlice</code> has new functions
       <code class="member">begin()</code> and <code class="member">end()</code>,
       returning the corresponding vector iterators.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The various tensor classes can now effectively be reset to zero
       by simply writing <code>t=0;</code> as has long been allowed for
       matrices and vectors.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code
       class="member">deal_II_numbers::is_finite</code> function can
       be used to check whether a floating point number is finite,
       i.e. neither plus or minus infinite nor NaN (not a number);
       it is in the new include file <tt>base/numbers.h</tt>, which will
       contain non-configured inline functions of this type.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/15) (GK 2006/03/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: If the C++ runtime environment allows it, we now
       demangle stacktraces generated whenever an exception is thrown.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The function <code class="class">Subscriptor</code>::<code
       class="member">list_subscribers</code> logs all current subscribers of an
       object to <tt>deallog</tt>.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: Writing a denormal "NaN" through <code

  <li> <p>Improved: The <code class="class">TableBase</code> base class of all
       the <code class="class">Table</code> classes had an
       <code class="member">>operator()</code> that takes a <code>TableIndices</code> object
       that represents the entire set of indices at once. However, due to C++
       name lookup rules, this operator wasn't accessible through the
       <code class="class">Table</code> class without explicitly specifying the base class
       name. This is now fixed by also providing a similar
       <code class="member">>operator()</code> in the derived classes.

       (WB 2006/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code class="class">QGauss</code> constructor
       hangs on x86 linux systems when deal.II is run from inside
       MATLAB. The reason is that while the processor offers long
       double accuracy, MATLAB switches off support for that inside
       the CPU. It therefore leaves codes that expect the additional
       accuracy high and dry. Annoyingly, these codes of course run
       just fine outside of MATLAB's environment. This behavior leads
       to an infinite loop inside the QGauss constructor, where we
       want to use the additional accuracy to compute quadrature
       points to high precision. To avoid the infinite loop, we now
       check during runtime whether the extra precision is available,
       not only at compile time.

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code class="member">ParameterHandler::get_integer</code>
       had an erroneous check that the value given for a parameter really
       represented an integer. This check always succeeded, even in face of an
       error, and a zero value was returned every time the value in the
       parameter file happened to be not an integer.

  <li> <p>Improved: The class <code
  class="class">LAPACKFullMatrix</code> now also uses LU factorization
  of LAPACK. The new wrapper <code class="class">PreconditionLU</code>
  allows us to use this as a preconditioner.
  <br>
  (GK 2006/10/02)

  a single vector.

  <li> <p>Improved: The class <code class="class">SolverCG</code> can
  now estimate the condition number of the linear system using <code
  class="class">TridiagonalMatrix</code> and LAPACK.
  <br>
  (GK 2006/09/06)

  <li> <p>New: the class <code class="class">TridiagonalMatrix</code>
  has been introduced together with its basic methods, including an
  eigenvalue solver for the symmetric case (LAPACK).
  <br>
  (GK 2006/09/06)
  </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: PETSc 2.3.1 (<i>build 16</i>) is now supported by the
       linear preconditioner classes. The new PETSc functions 
       <code class="member">PCFactorSetXXX</code> are used.<br>       
       (F. Prill, 2006/08/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The class <code class="class">TransposeMatrix</code>
  modeled after <code class="class">PointerMatrix</code> swaps the
  <code class="member">vmult</code> functions such that its effect is
  the transpose of the matrix it points to.
  <br>
  (GK 2006/07/07)

  <li> <p>New: There is now a function <code

       it does.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/06/16)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p>Improved: <code class="class">PointerMatrixAux</code> now has a
       default constructor and a function for setting the <code
       class="class">VectorMemory</code> object.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/06/14)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p>Fixed: <code
       class="member">FullMatrix::print</code> would yield a link error
       when used with <code>std::ofstream</code> since an explicit
       instantiation was missing. The function has now been moved to
       the header file and made inline so that it is always visible,
       whatever the type of the output stream is.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/06/07)
       </p>

  
  <li> <p> Improved: The <code
       class="class">SparseDirectUMFPACK</code> solver can now also be
       used with sparse matrices with elements of type float, as well
       as with block matrices with types float and double.

  <li> <p> New: There is a new class <code
       class="class">IdentityMatrix</code> that represents an
       efficient version of the matrix with ones on the diagonal and
       zeros everywhere else. The main usefulness of this matrix lies
       in the fact that most other important matrix classes have
       assignment operators and copy constructors that allow to
       conveniently fill a (sparse, full) matrix with the identity
       matrix.

       (GK 2006/03/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: All matrix (and some vector) classes now check whether
       entries written into them represent finite floating point
       values. This should catch some bugs earlier where one writes
       infinite or NaN values into a matrix only to realize later that
       the linear solver fails.

  <li> <p>
       Changed: There are new <code
       class="class">FullMatrix</code>::<code
       class="member">equ</code> functions which assign <tt>this</tt>
       matrix to the linear combination of one, two or three
       matrices. Also there is now a new <code

       function for three vectors.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/21)

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="class">SolverMinRes</code> class did not work
       with the <code class="class">BlockVector</code> class.
       This is now fixed.

       Changed: There are now new <code
       class="class">FullMatrix</code>::<code
       class="member">add</code> functions which add two and three
       scaled matrices.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/16)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The matrix classes <code
       class="class">FullMatrix</code>, <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix</code>, <code
       class="class">SparseMatrixEZ</code> and <code
       class="class">BlockMatrixBase</code> now have an <code
       class="member">add</code> function analogous to the <code
       class="member">add</code> of vector classes. The old <code
       class="member">add_scaled</code> functions are now deprecated.

       (RH 2006/02/16)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>       
       Improved: <code class="class">BlockMatrixArray</code>::<code
       class="member">enter_aux</code> allows using matrices without
       adding vector multiplication by using <code
       class="class">PointerMatrixAux</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/02/02)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code class="class">PointerMatrixAux</code> was
       introduced for use with matrix classes lacking the adding
       vector multiplication functions. It implements these by using
       its own auxiliary vector.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code class="class">FilteredMatrix</code> class
       was able to filter only the <code class="class">SparseMatrix</code>
       matrix class.
       A new (faster) version is now in its place with the same interface 
       that is able to perform such a filter on anything that provides 
       the usual matrix vector operations.
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/01/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: All solver classes took an argument of type <code
       class="class">VectorMemory</code> which they use to allocate
       memory for temporary vectors. A clever implementation of this
       class might allow reusing temporary vectors, and thus reduce
       the overhead of repeatedly allocating and freeing
       memory. However, almost all instances of using these classes
       used the <code class="class">PrimitiveVectorMemory</code>
       class. The solver class have now been changed so that if one
       omits the respective argument, they fall back to using such a
       memory object. Also, all example programs that did not
       specifically use a different memory allocation class, have been
       changed to not specify anything at all, and thus fall back to
       the default.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/11/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code class="class">SparseMatrix</code> iterators had a
       problem when one wrote code like <code>iterator->value()=0</code>
       (i.e. with a zero integer, rather than a floating point number on the
       right), in that that opened up a second conversion sequence and the
       compiler complained about an ambiguity. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Now the class <code class="class">SparseILU</code> supports
       also the <code class="member">Tvmult</code> method. This feature
       allows the straightforward use of <code class="class">SparseILU</code>
       as a multigrid smoother within the framework.

  <li> <p> Improved: The lookup mechanism in <code
       class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">get_fe_from_name</code> has been changed, so
       additional custom finite elements can be added using <code
       class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">add_fe_name</code>. In the course of this
       change, the implementation of the lookup mechanism has been

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new functions <code
       class="class">GridTools</code>::<code

       (WB 2006/10/23)

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code class="class">ConstraintMatrix</code> class did not
       allow that one degree of freedom was constrained against another DoF
       that was itself constrained. However, this is necessary for the
       implementation of hp methods and is now allowed. Arbitrarily long chains
       of constraints are resolved at the time the
       <code>ConstraintMatrix::close()</code> function is called. The only
       thing that is not allowed are cycles in such constraints.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/09/19)

       New: There are new functions <code

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The functions <code
       class="member">FETools::compute_embedding_matrices</code>,
       <code
       class="member">FETools::compute_face_embedding_matrices</code>, and
       <code
       class="member">FETools::compute_projection_matrices</code>
       (mostly used in internal computations in setting up finite
       element objects) previously took pointers to the first element
       of an array of matrices as arguments. This isn't type-safe, and
       in particular did not allow to check for the number of matrices
       in the array. The functions now take a reference to an array of
       the correct length.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/08/14)

       <br> 
       (WB 2006/08/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: <code 
		 class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code> now offers access to the
       full tensor of derivatives of orders one, two and three. This
       information can be requested for a single cell by means of the <code 
		 class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code><code
       class="member">::approximate_derivative_tensor</code> function. If the
       norm of this tensor is required later on, the new <code 
		 class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code><code
       class="member">::derivative_norm</code> function can be used. Note, that
       for second order derivatives, this returns the largest eigenvalue
       instead of the Frobenius norm, which is returned by the <code

       class="member">::norm</code> function.
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/08/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code 
		 class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code> offers approximated
       derivatives of a discrete function. The symmetrization of the derivative
       tensor is now done at the right place, i.e. the derivative itself is
       symmetrized instead of an intermediate tensor. This should improve the
       results slightly, but cause no problems otherwise, as this is completely
       internal to the class.
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/08/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code 
		 class="member">DataOut::build_patches</code> and similar
       functions in the related <code>DataOut*</code> classes allowed to pass
       zero as the second argument (denoting the number of threads to use if
       multithreading is enabled). This led to no output being created at
       all. This is now fixed by throwing an exception in this case.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/07/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new function <code class="class">FiniteElementBase</code>::<code
       class="member">n_dofs_per_object</code> returns either
       <code>dofs_per_vertex</code>, <code>dofs_per_line</code>,
       <code>dofs_per_quad</code>, ..., depending on the explicitly
       specified function template argument. This is often useful for
       template trickery.

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code 
		 class="member">Triangulation&lt;dim&gt;::fix_coarsen_flags</code>
       has been modified to allow coarsening in all possible cases. Up
       to now, coarsening was forbidden, if the neighbor cell was not refined
       but had the <code>refine_flag</code> set, whereas it was allowed, if
       the neighbor cell already was refined. Now, in both cases coarsening is
       allowed (if all children are flagged for coarsening). This leeds to
       triangulations with a slightly reduced number of cells. In some cases
       older references will have to be updated.

       class="member">lines()</code> and <code
       class="class">TriaObjectAccessor&lt;2,dim&gt;</code>::<code

  <li> <p>
       New: Function <code class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">create_point_source_vector</code> to calculate the projection
       of a Dirac pulse on the base functions. This models a point source as
       used in the calculations of Green's functions and can also be used to

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The old version of <code class="class">GridTools</code>::<code
       class="member">find_active_cell_around_point</code> has been replaced
       by a wrapper function for backward compatibility. The wrapper calls the
       new version of this function, and it is highly recommended to use the new
       version as it automatically delivers also the local coordinate of the
       point (so it can save some computation time in most cases as you don't have
       to calculate that again).

       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The functions <code class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">point_value</code> and <code class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">point_difference</code> now can also use arbitrary
       mappings, using the new <code class="class">GridTools</code>::<code
       class="member">find_active_cell_around_point</code> algorithm.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In <code>GridTools</code>, several functions have been added.
       <code>GridTools::find_closest_vertex</code> searches for the vertex
       located at closest distance to a given point. <code>
       GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex</code> allows to determine
       all cells adjacent to a given vertex. And finally, a new version of
       <code>find_active_cell_around_point</code>, which takes additionally
       a mapping as parameter, implements a new and faster algorithm to
       determine the active cell in which a given point is located. For
       points located on boundaries and edges, it is in most cases also able
       to give the finest cell.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2006/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>DoFObjectAccessor::get_dof_values</code> and
       <code>DoFObjectAccessor::set_dof_values</code> were part of the
       accessors for lines, quads, and hexes. However, they could not
       be called for these objects unless the object was actually a
       cell, i.e. one could never call this function for a line or
       face in 3d, for example. The functions have therefore been
       moved to the <code>DoFCellAccessor</code> class that provides
       access to cells (i.e. lines in 1d, quads in 2d, and hexes in
       3d) for which this operation is actually useful.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/05/01)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> Fixed: second derivatives where not computed correctly in <code
       class="class">FEFaceValuesBase</code>, i.e. when evaluating
       second derivatives on faces of cells. This is now fixed. Using
       second derivatives evaluated at quadrature points within a cell
       was not affected by this problem.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/04/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The functions <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_line</code>,
       <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_quad</code>, and
       <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_hex</code> can be used to
       selectively clear only some of the user flags as needed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>VectorTools::project</code> functions can now
       also be used for vector arguments of type other than
       <code>Vector&lt;double&gt;</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>GridTools::get_finest_common_cells</code> can be
       used to find those cells that are shared by two triangulations that are
       based on the same coarse mesh. This is useful, for example, when having
       to integrate the solution on one mesh against the shape functions on
       another mesh, a situation that frequently happens in time-dependent but
       also in nonlinear problems.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>GridTools::have_same_coarse_mesh</code> figures
       out whether two triangulations, two DoFHandlers, etc, are built on the
       same coarse mesh.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Since calling <code>cell-&gt;get_dof_indices</code> is a
       fairly frequent operation (called about 7 times per cell in
       step-14, but much more often in more complicated programs), the
       results of this function are now cached for faster access.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: An exception was generated when trying to interpolate
       boundary values for a primitive component of a composite finite
       element that also has non-primitive base elements (for example,
       trying to interpolate boundary values for a the last component
       of a RT x Q1 element). This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new function <code class="class">FiniteElement</code>::<code
       class="member">face_to_equivalent_cell_index</code> that can
       convert a face index of a degree of freedom into a
       corresponding cell index.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">point_value</code> that evaluate the value of a
       finite element function at a given point inside the domain.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code class="class">GridOut</code> now has functions for
       declaring and parsing parameters in a <code
       class="class">ParameterHandler</code>, like used in <code
       class="class">DataOut_Interface</code> for a long time.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code class="class">Triangulation</code>, <code
       class="class">PersistentTriangulation</code>, <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code>, <code
       class="class">hp::DoFHandler</code> and <code
       class="class">MGDoFHandler</code> classes now all have a <code
       class="member">dimension</code> variable which allows to ask
       the template argument <tt>dim</tt> by
       <class="class">SomeClass</code>::<code
       class="member">dimension</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: When used, the copy constructor of <code
       class="class">MappingQ</code> would lead to memory
       corruption. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code
       class="class">StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code
       class="member">mapping</code> object of type <code
       class="class">MappingQ1</code> which is used in several parts
       of the library. This way multiple creation and storage of <code
       class="class">MappingQ1</code> objects can be avoided.
       <br>
       Similar to <code class="class">StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code
       class="member">mapping</code> there is now also an object <code
       class="class">hp::StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code
       class="member">mapping_collection</code> of type <code
       class="class">MappingCollection</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code class="class">GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">write_gmsh</code> function to write in the gmsh 
       format. It has the same features of the write_ucd one. 
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/02/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code class="class">hp::FECollection</code>::<code
       class="member">get_fe</code>, <code
       class="class">hp::QCollection</code>::<code
       class="member">get_quadrature</code> and <code
       class="class">hp::MappingCollection</code>::<code
       class="member">get_mapping</code> functions are now renamed to
       the standard <code class="member">operator[]</code>
       function. Similarly, the <code
       class="class">FECollection</code>::<code
       class="member">n_finite_elements</code>, <code
       class="class">QCollection</code>::<code
       class="member">n_quadratures</code> and <code
       class="class">MappingCollection</code>::<code
       class="member">n_mappings</code> functions are now renamed to
       the standard <code class="member">size()</code> function.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">GridGenerator</code>::<code
       class="member">half_hyper_ball</code> now is implemented also 
       in three dimensions, and the boundary now is colored with 0 and one 
       respectively on the curved and plane.
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/02/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">FiniteElementData</code> and
       <code class="class">FiniteElement</code> now support the
       concept of blocks along with components. See the glossary for
       the difference.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code class="class">MGDoFHandler</code>::<code
       class="member">distribute_dofs</code> and <code
       class="member">renumber</code> functions could not handle
       coarsened grids (unused vertices, faces and cells). This is now
       fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/01/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Mapping</code> class and derived classes now have
       functions <code>clone()</code> that return a new object of the same
       (derived) type.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/1/8)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code> class now also allows to
       select the cells on which it is supposed to work by giving a material
       ID, instead of only a subdomain ID.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/1/4)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: A new <code>TriaAccessor::ExcCellHasNoChildren</code>
       exception will be raised if the <code
       class="member">TriaObjectAccessor::child_index</code> function
       is invoked for cells without children.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/12/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: We had a bug in <code class="member">DataOut::build_patches</code>
       that, when used in multithreaded mode, caused an exception to be
       thrown. In particular, this happened when the step-14 program was run on
       dual processor machines and the library was compiled for
       multithreading. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/10/20)

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="member">GridTools::delete_unused_vertices</code>
       function. Previously a <tt>private</tt> function in <code

       New: The <code
       class="member">GridIn&lt;dim&gt;::read_netcdf(string
       &filename)</code> function reads grids from NetCDF files. The
       only data format currently supported is the <tt>TAU grid
