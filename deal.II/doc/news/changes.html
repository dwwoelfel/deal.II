<h2>Changes after Version 5.1</h2>

<p>
This is the list of changes made after the release of 
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> version 5.1. It is subdivided into changes
made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>, 
<a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as
changes to the <a href="#general">general infrastructure,
documentation, etc</a>.

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: On certain systems running CygWin, a call to
       <code>gethostname()</code> could cause deal.II to hang. The reason
       seems to be that the call disables long double computations which
       revert to just double precision. This then leads to an endless loop in
       computing weights for quadrature points because the convergence
       criterion cannot be reached with simple double precision. This is now
       fixed by disabling the call to <code>gethostname()</code> on these
       systems.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz, WB, 2005/03/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The step-16 example program wasn't listed in the
       navigation bar of the  tutorial section, although it was in the
       table of contents. This is fixed now.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/02/09)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code>MultipleParameterLoop::UserClass</code> had only
       virtual abstract functions but no virtual destructor. This caused
       warnings with some compilers, and is generally bad practice
       anyway. This is now fixed. The same holds with respect to the class
       <code>DataOutInterface</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/02/20)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>SparseMatrix</code> iterators had no <code>operator
       &gt;</code>, only an <code>operator &lt;</code>. The missing operator
       is now implemented. The same holds for the <code>FullMatrix</code>
       class.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>SparseMatrix</code> iterators could not be compared
       using <code>operator &lt;</code>: the compiler complained that a
       private member was accessed. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/01)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code>MGDoFHandler</code> had trouble when it
       encountered a triangulation that had unused vertices, something
       that happens when one coarsens an existing triangulation. In
       that case, it would throw unjustified exceptions. This is now
       fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code>Triangulation::RefinementListener</code> had only
       virtual abstract functions but no virtual destructor. This caused
       warnings with some compilers, and is generally bad practice
       anyway. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/02/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Function <code class="class">FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">compute_embedding_matrices</code> allows for
       automatic computation of embedding matrices under the sole
       assumption that the coarse grid space is embedded into the fine
       grid space. In particular, no interpolation points are required.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Several wrong assertions in the Raviart-Thomas finite element
       class have been fixed, that were triggered when integrating face terms.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, 2005/01/24; 
        WB, 2005/01/31)
