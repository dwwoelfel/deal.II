<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Improved: make knows a target <tt>veryclean</tt>
  now. <tt>clean</tt> leaves the libraries now, removing everything
  that is not needed to use
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. <tt>veryclean</tt> removes even the
  libraries, leaving the directory more or less in the state like
  after <tt>configure</tt>.

<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: There are now operators to allow multiplication and
       division of <code class="class">Tensor</code> objects by scalar
       factors.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/07)

<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code class="member">get_dof_indices</code>
       functions of DoF accessor classes used to work also for
       non-active cells. However, the results were bogus except for
       the special case that we had a finite element that has all its
       degrees of freedom located in vertices. This is now fixed: the
       function throws an exception in all other cases, since there is
       no useful meaning for it then. It continues to work in the
       special case.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: For encapsulated postscript of 2d grids, it is now
       possible to tell the <code class="class">GridOut</code> to
       write the cell numbers into each cell.
       <br>
