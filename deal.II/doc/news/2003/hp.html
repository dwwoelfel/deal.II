<h2>Changes on the hp branch</h2>

<p>
This is the list of changes made on the hp branch; this list will be merged
back into the main document listing changes once the hp branch is merged as
well. Since the hp branch only exists in the deal.II subdirectory, only this
category exists below.

All entries are signed with the names of the author. Regular
contributor's names are abbreviated by WB (Wolfgang Bangerth), GK

<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="member">TriaDimensionInfo</code> and
       <code class="member">DoFDimensionInfo</code> classes that were used to
       declare typedefs for the iterators have been moved to a namespace
       internal (so as to get them out of the class index in the documentation
       -- these classes were not meant for use in applications after all), and
       have been renamed to <code class="member">TriaIteratorSelector</code>
       and <code class="member">DoFIteratorSelector</code>, since that is what
       they are.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Due to the demand for different <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code> classes (mainly for the planned
       hp-DoFHandler) the DoFHandler has been introduced as a
       template parameter into the <code class="class">DoFAccessor</code>,
       the <code class="class">DoFObjectAccessor</code>,
       and the <code class="class">DoFCellAccessor</code> classes.
       Furthermore the <code class="class">DoFHandler</code> was
       also introduced as template parameter into the
       <code class="class">DoFDimensionInfo</code>
       class. These changes induced several little changes in a couple
       of methods to get the code through the compiler. But no
       functionality was affected.

       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: There are now overloaded versions of the <code
       class="member">FEValues::reinit</code> function (and likewise in the
       <code class="class">FEFaceValues</code> and <code
       class="class">FESubFaceValues</code> classes) that either take a
       <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code> or a
       <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code>. That means that
       you can compute certain data with only the geometrical information the
       former provides, independent of whether degrees of freedom are
       associated with this cell or not. However, certain functions of the
       <code class="class">FEValues</code> class will throw an error if you
       attempt to use them without DoF data being delivered in the
       reinitialization call; these functions need to extract values from
       finite element fields, and are mostly the
       <code
       class="member">FEValues::get_function_values/grads/2nd_derivatives</code>
       functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell</code> and
       <code class="member">Mapping::transform_unit_to_real_cell</code>
       now only take a <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. This is also reasonable, since they only need the geometric
       information.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="member">FiniteElement::fill_fe_*_values</code>
       now only take a <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. Likewise for <code
       class="member">FiniteElementBase::compute_2nd</code> and <code
       class="member">FESystem::compute_fill</code>, and the 
       <code class="member">Mapping::fill_fe_*_values</code> functions.
