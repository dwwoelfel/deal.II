<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

<li> Removed: The interfaces to the obsolete direct solvers MA27 and MA47 from
the Harwell Subroutine Library. Support for the HSL routines were not ported to
the new build system. However, the sparse direct solver UMFPACK remains to be
supported and is provided as part of the standard deal.II distribution, unlike
the HSL functions.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/01)


<li> Changed: The TimeDependent::end_sweep function with an argument indicating
the number of threads has been removed. Use the corresponding function without
an argument. Since the argument had a default value, few users will have used
this function.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/03/17)

</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> New: The number of threads used by deal.II/TBB can now be limited at
  run time. Using MPI based code using PETSc/Trilinos no longer requires you
  to compile the library without threads. See MPI_InitFinalize and
  MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit for details.
  </li>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/03/26)

  <li> New: The results section of step-36 now explains how to use ARPACK
  as an alternative to SLEPc as eigenvalue solver.
  <br>
  (Juan Carlos Araujo Cabarcas, 2013/03/25)

  <li> New: deal.II now uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>
  as its configuration and build tool. Please read through the
  readme and other installation files for information about how the
  installation process has changed.
  <br>
  Because this touches the configuration of every external package we
  interact with, there are a number of other changes as a result:
  <ul>
    <li>The minimum supported version for Trilinos is now 10.8.x.
    <li>We no longer link with different versions of the p4est library
        in debug and optimized mode. Rather, we now link with the same
	library in both modes. The p4est installation instructions have
	been updated. <blink>TODO TODO TODO</blink>
  </ul>

<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
<li> Fixed: It is now possible to use the MeshWorker framework in 1d as well.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Scott Miller, 2013/04/09)
</li>

<li> Fixed: It was not possible to create a default-constructed object of
type Triangulation<1>::face_iterator. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Scott Miller, 2013/04/09)
</li>

<li> New: VectorTools::subtract_mean_value can now be called without a
boolean mask. The vector type is templatified and instantiated for all
non distributed vectors.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/08)
</li>

<li> Fixed: It is now possible to call ConvergenceTable::evaluate_convergence_rates
multiple times.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/08)
</li>

<li> Fixed: GridTools::distort_random (previously called Triangulation::distort_random)
had a bug where points were only ever moved in <i>positive</i> coordinate
directions rather than with uniform probability in either direction. The 1d
implementation also had the problem that it did not move vertices if the
<i>cell</i> they were on was at the boundary, even if the <i>vertex</i>
itself was not. All of these problems are now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/05)
</li>

<li> New: There is a class VectorFunctionFromTensorFunction that converts
between objects of type TensorFunction and Function.
<br>
(Spencer Patty, 2013/4/2)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The ParameterHandler class could not deal with parameters named
<code>"value"</code> (and a few other names). This is now fixed.
<br>
(Denis Davydov, Matthias Maier, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/3/31)
</li>

<li> Changed: TimerOutput no longer assumes that sections are not nested
when outputting percentage and total run time.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/3/28)
</li>

<li> New: MPI_InitFinalize can also initialize PETSc/Slepc when
not compiling with MPI. This is now the preferred way to initialize
MPI/PETSc/Slepc in all cases.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/3/26)
</li>

<li> Added/fixed: IterativeInverse::vmult() can now handle vectors
using a different number type than the matrix type. As usual, the
number types must be compatible. Addtitionally, the initial guess is
always set to zero, since starting with the incoming vector makes no
sense.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2013/03/21)
</li>

<li> Added GridOut::write_svg to allow for the output of two-dimensional
triangulations in two space dimensions in the SVG format (Scalable Vector
Graphics, an XML-based vector image format recommended by the World
Wide Web Consortium W3C). This function also provides cell coloring
and cell labeling for the visualization of basic cell properties.
<br>
(Christian WÃ¼lker, 2013/03/21)

<li> Added TimerOutput::reset to remove the collected information so far and
added a new frequency TimerOutput::never to only output information if
triggered by print_summary().
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/03/20)
</li>

<li> Changed: FEValuesExtractors::Scalar, FEValuesExtractors::Vector and
FEValuesExtractors::SymmetricTensor could not be default constructed, and
consequently one could not easily put them into arrays (where they would
be default constructed when changing the size, and later assigned useful
values). These classes can now be default constructed to invalid
values, but can of course not be used in any useful way.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/03/15)
</li>

<li> Fixed: FETools::interpolation_difference did not work with PETSc.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/03/01)
</li>

</ol>
