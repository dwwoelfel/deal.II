After one year of development, version 4.0 of the deal.II
object-oriented finite element library has been released. It is
available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org

This versions features many new components. The most outstanding
additions are
- Support for Nedelec edge elements; in general, we now support
  vector-valued elements where the vector components are coupled
- An implementation of Q(r) elements with hierarchic shape functions
- A new and simpler-to-use multi-threading scheme
- A much faster scheme to read in grids in 2d
- Support for more compilers and operating systems
- ...

A comprehensive list of new features can be found at
     http://www.dealii.org/news/3.4.0-vs-4.0.0.html

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and
improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP)
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
