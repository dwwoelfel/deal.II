Version 3.3  of the well-known deal.II  object-oriented finite element
library has been released. It  is available from the deal.II home-page
at
      http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal

The most important improvements over the previous version are:
- Support for the graphical file formats used by Tecplot and OpenDX.
- An example program demonstrating the Discontinuous  Galerkin  Finite
  Element Method (DGFEM).
- Support for subdomains, thus simplifying the  creation  of  programs
  that run on clusters of computers.

Beside  these,  the  list  of  changes  comprises  more  than  50  new
functions, classes, and bug fixes.  A concise list with respect to the
previous version can be found at
 http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal/news/2002/3.2.0-vs-3.3.0.html

All main  features of  the previous versions  have been  continued and
improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- Continuous and discontinuous elements of higher order
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP)
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II is  distributed under an Open  Source license and  is free for
non-commercial use.
