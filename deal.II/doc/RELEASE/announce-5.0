After almost two years of development, version 5.0 of the deal.II
object-oriented finite element library has been released. It is
available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org

Version 5.0 is another major step for this library. The most important
change is the addition of interfaces to the PETSc library to provide a
second set of linear system support classes besides the original
deal.II ones.  Via PETSc and an interface to METIS, parallel finite
element computations on clusters of computers have become as simple as
sequential ones.  Through this, the library has proven to support
computations with more than 10 million unknowns.

In addition to this, the most noteworthy changes are:
- Two new example programs, demonstrating one-dimensional nonlinear 
  problems and parallel computations with PETSc
- The use of doxygen for the generation of our several-thousand pages
  strong documentation, with significantly better cross-linking between
  pages
- Much better support for three-dimensional computations. Several
  topological restrictions on unstructured 3d meshes have been lifted,
  and a number of long-standing bugs have been fixed. We can now also
  read in 3d meshes with several 100,000 cells in a few seconds
- Support for Raviart-Thomas elements in 2d and 3d.
- Support for more compilers and operating systems

A comprehensive list of new features and fixed bugs can be found at
     http://www.dealii.org/news/4.0.0-vs-5.0.0.html

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and
improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP)
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
