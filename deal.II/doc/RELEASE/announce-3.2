Version 3.2  of the well-known deal.II  object-oriented finite element
library has been released. It  is available from the deal.II home-page
at
      http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal

The most important improvements are:
- Mapping of arbitrary order at curved boundaries.  This includes  the
  possibility of using sub-, iso-, and super-parametric  elements,  as
  well as C1 mappings and shape functions depending on the actual grid
  cell.
- A matrix class for conveniently filtering Dirichlet boundary  values
  without modifying the system matrix.
- A wide variety of target systems by ISO C++ conformance.
Beside  these,  the  list  of  changes comprises  more  than  100  new
functions, classes, and bug fixes.  A concise list with respect to the
previous version can be found at
 http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal/news/2000/3.1.0-vs-3.2.0.html

All main  features of  the previous versions  have been  continued and
improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- Continuous and discontinuous elements of higher order
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP)
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms

deal.II is  distributed under an Open  Source license and  is free for
non-commercial use.
