Version 3.2 of the well-known object-oriented finite element library
deal.II has been released. It is available from the deal.II home-page
at

      http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal

The most important improvements are:

- Mapping of arbitrary order at curved boundaries. This includes the
  possibility of using hypo-, iso- and hyperparametric elements, as
  well as shape functions depending on the actual grid cell..
- A matrix class for conveniently filtering Dirichlet boundary values
  without reassembling the system matrix.
- A wide variety of target systems by ISO C++ conformance.


A concise list of all changes with respect to the previous version can
be found at

 http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~deal/news/2000/3.1.0-vs-3.2.0.html

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:

- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- Continuous and discontinuous elements of higher order
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms

An still, deal.II is distributed under an Open Source license and it
is free for noncommercial use.
