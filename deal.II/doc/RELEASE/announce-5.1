Version 5.1 of the deal.II object-oriented finite element library has been
released. It is available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Version 5.1 offers a number of improvements over previous versions. In
particular, it contains a version of the sparse direct solver package UMFPack,
as well as corresponding interfaces to use it from within deal.II.

In addition to this, the most noteworthy changes are:
- Vectors and matrices built on top of PETSc objects are now completely
  integrated. In particular, it is possible to build block vectors and
  matrices with them.
- In 3d, Lagrange elements now implement hanging node constraints for all
  polynomial orders, not only for the first few
- Several classes have been optimized to use algorithms with a better
  complexity in terms of memory use or run time
- Support for DLLs on Microsoft Windows.

A comprehensive list of new features and fixed bugs can be found at
     http://www.dealii.org/news/5.0.0-vs-5.1.0.html

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP)
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
