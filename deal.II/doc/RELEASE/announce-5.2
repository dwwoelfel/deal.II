Version 5.2 of the deal.II object-oriented finite element library has been
released. It is available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Version 5.2 offers a number of improvements over previous versions. In
particular, the most noteworthy changes are:
- There are two more tutorial programs that demonstrate solving 3d, quasi-
  static elasticity problems in parallel as well as some data handling
  techniques
- Support for parsing and evaluating functions given in text, rather than
  in program form
- A new graphical output format that can later be converted to the file
  formats understood by a large number of visualization packages
- Optimization of the interface to PETSc, in particular for distributed
  sparse matrices
- Full support for computations with symmetric tensors
- Many improvements in the generation of our 4000+ page documentation
- Fixes for all the bugs that have come to our attention in the last
  9 months.

A comprehensive list of almost 100 new features and fixed bugs can be found at
     http://www.dealii.org/5.2.0/news/5.1.0-vs-5.2.0.html

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Multigrid support
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP) and distributed
  computing
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
