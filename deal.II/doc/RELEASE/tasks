This file is internal information only. It lists the steps to be done
when a new release shall be issued:

- if a x.y.0 release, create a branch:

  $DEAL/common/scripts/cvs-create-branch x y

  This script will create a branch tag Branch-x.y for you. Before using
  the script check the last cvs call in this script and update files and
  directories not to be released.

- test the branch thoroughly

- Rename the changes file and create a new one for the next release

- adjust news.html. Crosslink changes file. If necessary link an
  announcement. Do these things on both HEAD and branch. Be sure to
  have the changes file on both HEAD and branch.

- adjust download.html on both HEAD and branch

- cvs tag all files with Version-x-y-z

- cvs export -r Version-x-y-z and form a tarball of that

- put it onto the web server

- wait overnight

- announce the relase
