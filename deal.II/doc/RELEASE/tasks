This file is internal information only. It lists the steps to be done
when a new release shall be issued:

0/ cvs update -d -P

*** Caveat: for a minor version x.y.Z,
*** 1-3 must be performed on Branch-x-y
*** AND on HEAD

1/ rename the changes file and create a new one for the next release

2/ adjust news.html. Crosslink changes file. If necessary link an
  announcement.

3/ adjust download.html.

4/ if a x.y.0 release, create a branch:
	call common/scripts/cvs-create-branch <x> <y>

5/  cvs update -P -r Branch-<x>-<y>
	or
	cvs checkout -P -r Branch-<x>-<y> deal.II

6/ change the content of the `Version' file on both HEAD and branch

7/ test the branch thoroughly:
	make all
	cd tests
	make all
	cd ../examples
	make all
	make run

8/ run `make validate-xrefs' on the branch to check that the changes
  do not point to nirvana

9/ cvs tag all files with Version-x-y-z

10/ tell your friends to tag their programs

11/ cvs export -P -r Version-x-y-z and form a tarball of that

12/ put it on the web server

13/ wait overnight

14/ announce the release
       follow the instructions in ./announce.pl
