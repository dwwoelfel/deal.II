This file is internal information only. It lists the steps to be done
when a new release shall be issued:

0/ cvs update -d -P

*** Caveat: for a minor version x.y.Z,
*** 1-3 must be performed on Branch-x-y
*** AND on HEAD

1/ rename the changes file and create a new one for the next release

2/ adjust news.html: new entry for the release, remove temporary entry
  used to show changes after last release. Crosslink changes file. If
  necessary link an announcement.

3/ obsolete

4/ if a x.y.0 release, create a branch:
	call common/scripts/cvs-create-branch <x> <y>

5/  cvs update -P -r Branch-<x>-<y>
	or
    cvs checkout -P -r Branch-<x>-<y> deal.II

    cd deal.II
    cvs checkout tests

6/ change the content of the `Version' file on both HEAD and branch

7/ test the branch thoroughly:
	make distclean (if applicable)
	./configure
	make all
	cd tests
	make all
	cd ../examples
	make all
	make run

8/ run `make online-doc' on the branch and check that no link
  points to Nirvana

9/ cvs tag all files with Version-x-y-z

10/ tell your friends to tag their programs

11a/ cvs export -P -r Version-x-y-z and form a tarball of that.

11b/ Produce the online documentation and form a tarball of the doxygen output

12/ put it on the web server.

13/ Add links to navbar.html and toc.html on homepage.

14/ Log in as deal and execute "makedoc_version x.y.z"
    Report errors!!!

15/ wait overnight

16/ announce the release
       follow the instructions in ./announce.pl

17/ Celebrate!
