This file is internal information only. It lists the steps to be done
when a new release shall be issued:

0/
	cvs update -d -P
	perl common/scripts/status.pl -c
	make all
	cd tests ; make all ; cd ..
	cd examples ; make all ; cd ..

*** Caveat: for a minor version x.y.Z,
*** 1-3 must be performed on Branch-x-y
*** AND on HEAD

1/ rename the changes file and create a new one for the next release

2/ adjust news.html: new entry for the release, remove temporary entry
  used to show changes after last release. Crosslink changes file. If
  necessary link an announcement.

3/ Commit the changes of step 2!

4/ if a x.y.0 release, create a branch:
	call common/scripts/cvs-create-branch <x> <y>

5/  cvs checkout -P -r Branch-<x>-<y> deal.II
    mv deal.II checkout
    cd checkout
    cvs checkout -r Branch-<x>-<y> tests

6/ change the version in configure.in on both HEAD and branch; version
   on branch should have THREE digits.

7/ test the branch thoroughly:
	make distclean (if applicable)
	./configure --with-umfpack
	make all
	cd tests
	make all
	cd ../examples
	make all
	make run

8/ run `make online-doc' on the branch and check that no link
  points to Nirvana

9/ cvs tag all files with Version-x-y-z

10/ tell your friends to tag their programs

11/ call common/scripts/make_tarfile.sh in the directory containing 'checkout'

12/ put both tar files on the web server.

13/ Add links to download/index.html, navbar.html and toc.html on homepage.

14/ Log in as deal and execute "makedoc_version x.y.z"
    Report errors!!!

15/ wait overnight

16/ announce the release
       follow the instructions in ./announce.pl

17/ Celebrate!
