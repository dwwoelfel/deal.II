    <h3> Using <acronym>deal.II</acronym> in a CMake project </h3>

    <p>
      <code>cmake</code> is the configuration and build tool we use
      in <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Its advantage is not only that it makes
      configuration of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> itself simpler across
      platforms (compared to the older <code>autoconf/make</code> combination)
      but also that it <i>exports</i> information about the deal.II
      configuration that makes it particularly simple for projects
      using <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to configure and link against it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>cmake</code> is controlled by input files that by convention are
      called <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, listing both configuration commands
      as well as dependencies between source files and targets.
      This page presents some <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> examples for
      potential use in your projects. A detailed description of the
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> project configuration is given in the
      <a href="cmake.html" target="body">deal.II CMake ReadMe</a>.

    <h4>Simple CMakeLists.txt</h4>

    <p>
      The easiest way to write a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is to use
      an "autopilot" style macro. Here is an example for the step-1
      tutorial program (<a href="CMakeLists.txt.example"
      target="_top">plain text</a> version) that can be used for simple
      projects:
      <pre>

    #
    # Set the name of the project and target:
    #
    SET(TARGET "step-1")

    #
    # Declare all source files the target consists of:
    #
    SET(TARGET_SRC
      ${TARGET}.cc
      # You can specify additional files here!
      )

    #
    # (Optional)
    # Specify a list of files (file globs) that will be removed
    # with the "make runclean" and "make distclean" targets.
    # If empty, sensible default values will be used.
    #
    SET(CLEAN_UP_FILES
      # a custom list of globs, e.g. *.log *.vtk
      )

    #
    # (Optional)
    # A custom command line that should be invoked by "make run". If empty,
    # ./${TARGET} will be invoked.
    #
    SET(TARGET_RUN
      # a custom command line, e.g. mpirun -np 2 ${TARGET}
      )

    #
    # It is good practice to specify a version requirement:
    #
    CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.8.8)

    #
    # Find and import the deal.II project configuration:
    #
    FIND_PACKAGE(deal.II 8.0 REQUIRED
      HINTS
        ${DEAL_II_DIR} ../ ../../ ../../../ ../../../../../ $ENV{DEAL_II_DIR}
      #
      # If the deal.II library cannot be found (because it is not installed at a
      # default location or your project resides at an uncommon place), you
      # can specify additional hints for search paths here, e.g.
      # "$ENV{HOME}/workspace/deal.II"
      #
      )

    #
    # And let deal.II do the rest:
    #
    DEAL_II_INITIALIZE_CACHED_VARIABLES()
    PROJECT(${TARGET})
    DEAL_II_INVOKE_AUTOPILOT()
      </pre>

      This <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is intended for use with a small
      project and <i>in-source</i> build (i.e., one does not create a separate
      build directory as we recommend for the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> build
      in the <a href="../readme.html#configuration" target="_body">readme
      file</a>). Using this input file, you can run <code>cmake</code> in the
      source directory as follows:
      <pre>

    $ cd step-1
    $ cmake .

    [...]

    ###
    #
    #  Successfully set up project  step-1  with  deal.II-8.0.pre  found at
    #      /usr/local
    #
    #  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:   Debug
    #  TARGET_SRC:         step-1.cc
    #
    #  You can now run
    #      $ make            - to compile and link the program
    #      $ make run        - to (compile, link and) run the program
    #
    #      $ make debug      - to switch the build type to "Debug"
    #      $ make release    - to switch the build type to "Release"
    #      $ make edit_cache - to change (cached) configuration variables
    #                          and rerun the configure and generate phases of CMake
    #
    #      $ make clean      - to remove the generated executable as well as
    #                          all intermediate compilation files
    #      $ make runclean   - to remove all output generated by the program
    #      $ make distclean  - to clean the directory from _all_ generated
    #                          files (includes clean, runclean and the removal
    #                          of the generated build system)
    #
    #  Have a nice day!

    <h4>Advanced CMakeLists.txt</h4>

    <p>
      For large projects the simple <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> presented
      above tends to be too inflexible.
      So, if you wish to have more control about targets the
      <code>DEAL_II_SETUP_TARGET</code> macro might be of interest for you.
      Here is a full example, again using the step-1 tutorial program as a
      template:
      <pre>

    #
    # It is good practise to specify a version requirement:
    #
    CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.8.8)

    #
    # Find and import the deal.II project configuration:
    #
    FIND_PACKAGE(deal.II 8.0 REQUIRED
      HINTS
        ${DEAL_II_DIR} ../ ../../ ../../../ ../../../../../ $ENV{DEAL_II_DIR}
      #
      # If the deal.II library cannot be found (because it is not installed at a
      # default location or your project resides at an uncommon place), you
      # can specify additional hints for search paths here, e.g.
      # "$ENV{HOME}/workspace/deal.II"
      #
      )

    #
    # Initialize cached variables: This will set the compiler and
    # compiler flags to the values deal.II was configured with, as well as,
    # CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to "Debug".
    # These values can be altered by editing the cache via
    #   $ make edit_cache
    #
    DEAL_II_INITIALIZE_CACHED_VARIABLES()

    #
    # PROJECT has to be called after DEAL_II_INITIALIZE_CACHED_VARIABLES
    # otherwise CMake will have already set the compiler and compiler
    # flags.
    #
    PROJECT(step-1)

    #
    # Specify a target:
    #
    ADD_EXECUTABLE(step-1 step-1.cc)

    #
    # DEAL_II_SETUP_TARGET will set up all necessary include paths,
    # preprocessor definitions and the link interface:
    #
    DEAL_II_SETUP_TARGET(step-1)

    #
    # (Optional)
    # If you wish to have a "run" target for make, specify one:
    #
    ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET(run
      COMMAND step-1
      COMMENT "Run ${TARGET} with ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} configuration"
      )
      </pre>

    Further details can be found in the <a href="cmake.html#ext"
      target="body">deal.II CMake ReadME</a>.

    <h3> Legacy Make.global_options </h3>

    <p>
      Before version 8.0, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> used the
      traditional <code>autoconf/make</code> configuration and build
      system. The interaction between these two programs, as well as
      propagation of information from <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to user
      programs happened through a number of files that were generated within
      the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> directory tree.
      The CMake build system sets up the following compatibility files (if
      <code>DEAL_II_COMPONENT_COMPAT_FILES</code> is set, which is default):
      <pre>

    ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
        ./common/Make.global_options
        ./common/scripts/expand_instantiations
        ./common/scripts/make_dependencies
        ./common/scripts/report_features
      </pre>

      Therefore, it should be sufficient to set <code>D</code> in the old
      user Makefiles to:
      <pre>

    D=/path/install/dir
      </pre>
      where <code>/path/install/dir</code> is the directory set up via
      <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> (the path
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> was installed to).
