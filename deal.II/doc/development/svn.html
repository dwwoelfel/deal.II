  <h1>Documentation of the deal.II SVN Archive</h1>

  <h2>The global structure</h2>


  The root of the deal.II archive is located
  at <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/">http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/</a>.
  There are three subdirectories:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/">trunk</a>:
      This is the location of the current development version; it contains the
    directories <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/deal.II">deal.II</a>
    with the library proper
    and <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/tests">tests</a>
    with the testsuite.

    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/tags/">tags</a>:
    contains released versions. They have the same
    structure as the trunk.

    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/">branches</a>:
    currently active branches; it also has subdirectories:
      <ul>
	<li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/releases">releases</a>:
	branches for releases of deal.II
	  <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/retired">retired</a>:
	  development branches that have been merged into the
	  trunk and are no longer used.
	    </ul>
      </ul>

  <h2>Creating a development branch</h2>

  <p>
    Significant new functionality can often not be developed all at once. In a
    case like this, one can create a development branch in the subversion
    repository into which one can check in all necessary changes and from which
    one can merge the final set of changes into the main development line once
    ready. The <tt>svn</tt> program can be used
    to keep your branch up-to-date with the trunk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating a branch works through the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li> Create the branch using
      <pre>

	svn copy http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/ http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>

    <li> Either check out the new branch or switch your working copy by
      <pre>

	svn switch http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>
      This command assumes you are in the top level directory, the one
      containing <tt>deal.II</tt> and <tt>tests</tt>

    <li> After some development of the branch, if you want to merge changes
    that have been made on mainline in the meantime, you can use this command:
      <pre>

	svn merge ^/trunk
      </pre>
      This command will only run if you have no local changes in your working
      directory for the branch, and will modify all of your files by merging
      the changes made on mainline. If there are no conflicts that need to be
      resolved, you can simply commit the result.
  </ol>
