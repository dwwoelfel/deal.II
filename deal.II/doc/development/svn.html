  <h1>Documentation of the deal.II SVN Archive</h1>

  <h2>The global structure</h2>


  The root of the deal.II archive is located
  at <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/">http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/</a>.
  There, we can find three subdirectories:
  <ul>
    <li> The current version is found
    in <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/">trunk</a>,
    which contains the
    directories <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/deal.II">deal.II</a>
    with the library
    and <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/tests">tests</a>
    with the test suite.

    <li> The
    subdirectory <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/tags/">tags</a>
    contains the released versions. They have the same
    structure as the trunk.

    <li> The
    subdirectory <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/">branches</a>
    has currently active branches with developments, that are not yet
    scheduled to be incorporated into the library. Additionally, it has subdirectories
      <ul>
	<li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/releases">releases</a>
	with the branches on which the releases are,
	  <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/retired">retired</a>
	  with development branches which have been merged into the
	  trunk and are therefore not used anymore.
	    </ul>
      </ul>

  <h2>Creating a development branch</h2>

  When starting new developments which cannot be checked in in a
  single sweep, it is advised to create a development branch. In order
  to keep this branch up-to-date with the trunk, the
  program <tt>svnmerge</tt> can be used. Such a branch is created in
  the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li> Create the branch using
      <pre>
	svn copy http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/ http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>
    <li> Either check out the new branch or switch your working copy by
      <pre>
	svn switch http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>
      This command assumes you are in the top level directory, the one
      containing <tt>deal.II</tt> and <tt>tests</tt>
    <li> Initialize the merge tracking svnmerge: in the top level directory, call
      <pre>
	svnmerge.py init
	svn ci -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt
	rm svnmerge-commit-message.txt
      </pre>
      This should be done before making any local changes!
  </ol>
