    <h1>Porting <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to new systems</h1>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses very few
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a> specific system
      features and is otherwise fairly ISO (1998) C++ Standard compliant.

      Consequently, there is a good chance that <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      will run on a reasonably well behaved system besides the ones listed
      in the <a href="readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>. Nevertheless,
      there are cases where some adjustments are necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Unknown compiler</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> CMake Buildsystem
      recognizes
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>,
      <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, as well as
      <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers">icc</a>, and
      sets up reasonable default compiler flags.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To start porting for an unkown compiler, specify
          <code>-DDEAL_II_SETUP_DEFAULT_COMPILER_FLAGS=OFF</code> and set all
          necessary compiler flags by hand via
          <pre>

    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS           - used during all builds
    DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG   - additional flags for the debug library
    DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE - additional flags for the release library
          </pre>
          After that try to compile the library with minimal external
          dependencies (<code>-DDEAL_II_ALLOW_AUTODETECTION=OFF</code>, for
          further information see the <a href="cmake.html">deal.II CMake
            documentation</a>).
        <li>
          For adding permanent support for the unknown compiler to the
          build system, have a look at
          <pre>

    cmake/setup_compiler_flags.cmake
    cmake/setup_compiler_flags_gnu.cmake
    cmake/setup_compiler_flags_icc.cmake
          </pre>
          Patches are highly welcome! See <a href="../mail.html">here</a>
          for information on how to get in contact with us.
        <li>
          You might want to have a look at
          <pre>

    cmake/checks/check_for_compiler_bugs.cmake
    cmake/checks/check_for_compiler_features.cmake
    cmake/checks/check_for_cxx_features.cmake
    include/deal.II/base/config.h.in
          </pre>
          to see how compiler specific checks are done.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Porting to a new platform</h2>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should support almost all reasonably
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a> compliant
      platforms out of the box. Nevertheless, the following bits of
      information might help:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The buildsystem of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses <a
          href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a>.  So,
          in order to port <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new platform,
          it is obviously necessary that <a href="http://www.cmake.org/"
          target="_top">CMake</a> supports the platform in question
          with at least one generator for a native build tool, see <a
          href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html">here</a>.
        <li>
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is mainly developed with <a
          href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> on GNU/Linux, so it is
          best to begin porting to a new platform with the help of <a
          href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>.
          After that a platform specific compiler might be tried.
        <li>
          Almost all <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a>
          specific code is well guarded with fall-back code in case the
          specific POSIX function is not available. There is (currently)
          one exception, though: Certain routines in
          <code>source/base/timer.cc</code> have implementations for POSIX
          and Windows and throw a compile time error on other platforms.
        <li>
          Have a look at
          <pre>

    cmake/checks/check_for_compiler_bugs.cmake
    cmake/checks/check_for_compiler_features.cmake
    cmake/checks/check_for_cxx_features.cmake
    cmake/checks/check_for_system_features.cmake
    include/deal.II/base/config.h.in
          </pre>
          to see how platform and compiler specific checks are done.
	<li>
          Of course, we would be happy to hear about the changes you made
          for your system, so that we can include them into the next version
          of the library!
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Cross compiling</h2>

    <p>
      It is possible to use <a href="http://www.cmake.org/"
      target="_top">CMake</a> to cross compile
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> for a foreign platform.  It is best
      to start cross compiling with minimal external dependencies
      (<code>-DDEAL_II_ALLOW_AUTODETECTION=OFF</code>, see the
      <a href="cmake.html">deal.II CMake documentation</a>).
      Further information on that topic can be found in the <a
      href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling">CMake
      wiki</a>.
