    <h3>Generic Makefiles</h3>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with sample Makefiles for
    applications that use this library. They show how to use the information
    provided by the variables explained above.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, there are two such Makefile templates. All Makefiles
    need slight modifications before they will work in your
    project; the places for modifications are marked and easy to find. The
    templates are:

    <ul>
      <li> <p>
           <a href="makefile.small.html" target="body">Small
           project Makefile</a>: This Makefile is targeted at small
           applications consisting of only a single <code>.cc</code>
           file. Examples of this kind are the
           <a href="../doxygen/tutorial/index.html" target="_top">step-by-step
           tutorial programs</a>.
	   You can find this Makefile
	   <a href="Makefile.small" target="_top">here</a>.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           <a href="makefile.large.html" target="body">Large
           projects</a>: This file is targeted at larger projects, and
           for this file to work, we already assume a certain
           subdirectory structure of your project. In particular, it
           assumes that in your project directory the following
           subdirectories exist (where <code>project</code> is the
           directory in which the whole project is located):
	   </p>
	   <ul>
	   <li> <code>project/source</code>: The location of all
	   your <code>.h</code> files.
	   <li> <code>project/include</code>: The location of all
	   your <code>.cc</code> files.
	   <li> <code>project/lib</code>: Where the Makefile will
		  put the final executable.
                <ul>
		  <li> <code>project/lib/1d</code>: Where the Makefile will
		  put your object files if you compile for 1d.
		  <li> <code>project/lib/2d</code>: Same for 2d.
		  <li> <code>project/lib/3d</code>: Same for 3d.
                </ul>
	   </ul>
	   <p>
	     Using this
             directory structure, it is possible to quickly switch
             between dimensions in which a program shall run in,
             enabling us to develop applications which run in 1d, 2d, or
             3d without long compilation times. Furthermore, placing
             object files in different directories prevents cluttering
             directories with unnecessarily many files.
	   </p>

	   <p>
	     The dimension for which the project shall be compiled is
	     not stated in the source code, as in the small projects
	     Makefile, but is determined by a flag set in the
	     Makefile. The Makefile then makes sure that the preprocessor
	     constant <code>deal_II_dimension</code> is set appropriately and
	     passed through to the compiler when creating object files.
	   </p>

	   <p>
	   You can find this Makefile
	   <a href="Makefile.large" target="_top">here</a>.
	   </p>
    </ul>
