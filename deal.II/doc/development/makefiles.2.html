    <h3>Generic Makefiles</h3>

    <p>
    In this section, we provide templates for Makefiles for
    applications based on the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    libraries. They show how to use the information provided by the
    variables explained above.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, we have two Makefiles, one for 
    <a href="makefile.small.html" target="body">small projects</a>
    consisting of only one C++ file, and one for 
    <a href="makefile.large.html" target="body">large projects</a>.
    Both Makefiles need slight modifications before they will work in
    your project. The places for modifications are marked.

    <ul>
      <li> <p>
           <a href="makefile.small.html" target="body">Small
           projects</a>: This Makefile is targeted at applications which
           are written to simply try something, or prove an
           assumption. Such applications are the 
           <a href="../tutorial/chapter-2.step-by-step/index.html" target="_top">step-by-step
           examples</a>. These small problems are probably not the
           usual case in real life, but you may want to take a look at
           this file in order to get an idea on how it works, or you
           go directly to the large projects file.
	   </p>

	   <p>
	   You can find this Makefile
	   <a href="Makefile.small" target="_top">here</a>.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           <a href="makefile.large.html" target="body">Large
           projects</a>: This file is targeted at larger projects, and
           for this file to work, we already assume a certain
           subdirectory structure of your project. In particular, it
           assumes that in your project directory the following
           subdirectories exist (where <code>project</code> is the
           directory in which the whole project is located):
	   <ul>
	   <li> <code>project/source</code>
	   <li> <code>project/include</code>
	   <li> <code>project/lib</code>
                <ul>
		  <li> <code>project/lib/1d</code>
		  <li> <code>project/lib/2d</code>
		  <li> <code>project/lib/3d</code>
                </ul>
	   </ul>
	   Include files need to be placed into
           <code>project/include</code>, while implementation files
           are to be in <code>project/source</code>. The executable
           will be in <code>project/lib</code> and the compiled object
           files will be in <code>project/lib/?d</code>, depending on
           the dimension for which the project is compiled. Using this
           directory structure, it is possible to quickly switch
           between dimensions in which a program shall run in,
           enabling us to develop applications which run in 1d, 2d, or
           3d without long compilation times. Furthermore, placing
           object files in different directories prevents cluttering
           directories with unnecessarily many files.
	   </p>

	   <p>
	   The dimension for which the project shall be compiled is
	   not stated in the source code, as in the small projects
	   Makefile, but is determined by a flag which is given in the
	   Makefile. To determine the dimension for which a project is
	   compiled in your source file, use the preprocessor constant
	   `deal_II_dimension' which is set by the Makefile and passed
	   through the compiler.
	   </p>

	   You can find this Makefile
	   <a href="Makefile.large" target="_top">here</a>.
