    <h1>Information on development with <acronym>deal.II</acronym></h1>

    <p>
    Apart from the online API references (the "manual") and the tutorial,
    which are covered elsewhere, this page gathers some information on
    developing programs based on
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, as well as on how to contribute
    to the development of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> itself. In the
    latter case, we encourage you to use the current development version
    instead of a pre-packaged version of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, as
    described on our <a
    href="http://www.dealii.org/download/">download page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, we have the following resources available:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> <p> Documentation of the <a href="svn.html">SVN Archive</a> and
	 information on <a href="http://www.dealii.org/changelogs/index.html"
         target="body">recent changes to the library</a>.</p>

    <li> <p>
         <a href="cmake.html">deal.II CMake documentation</a>:
         This page provides extensive information about usage and
         development of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> CMake build system.

    <li> <p><a href="cmakelists.html" target="body">Example CMakeLists.txt</a>:
         An overview of how to write the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> input
         files that control <code>cmake</code> if you want to use it for your
         own project and want it to compile and link against
         the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library.
         </p>

    <li> <p><a href="writing-documentation.html" target="body">Writing
         documentation</a>: To document the library and our
         application programs, we use
	 <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>.
         This page documents the basics of the format in
         which the documentation needs to be written in order to
         enable automatic documentation generation.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="porting.html" target="body">Porting
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new system</a>:

         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses CMake as build system
         and is fairly ISO (1998) C++ Standard compliant.
         So, porting to a reasonably <a
         href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a> compliant
         system with a reasonably ISO C++ compliant compiler shouldn't be
         much work. Other (mostly proprietary) systems might require more
         work. See the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
         file for more information on already supported systems. This
         resource gives some hints for porting to unknown platforms.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/dealii" target="_top">Bugs</a>:
         Though well tested, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> certainly has
         bugs. If you want to report a bug (or enhancement request),
         go to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/dealii"
         target="_top">bug tracking system</a> and enter a new ticket
         for your issue.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="doxygen.html">Linking your online documentation
	  to the deal.II online manual</a>: After spending a lot of time
	writing good documentation for your code and putting it online,
	here we explain how to put links to the deal.II online manual into
	your documentation, so that readers can click through.
      </p>

    <li> <p><a href="testsuite.html" target="body">Running the testsuite</a>:
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a testsuite that we run to
         make sure that our tests don't break any existing
         functionality. This page explains its use.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="../doxygen/deal.II/CodingConventions.html"
         target="body">Coding conventions</a>: We try to adhere to a
         set of coding conventions to ensure that the use of different
         parts of the library is as uniform as possible. Please read
         through them if you think about contributing code.

    <li> <p><a
         href="http://www.dealii.org/~archiver/cgi-bin/regression_quick.pl"
         target="body">Results of regression tests:</a> Every night,
         the regression tests are run on some of our machines. The log of the
         results can be seen here.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="http://www.dealii.org/~archiver/cgi-bin/build.pl">
	  Results of build tests:</a> We also build the library each night on
	  a variety of computers, using different compilers. The results of
	  these builds is listed as well.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="http://www.dealii.org/~archiver/benchmark.html">
	  Results of benchmarks:</a> We run a certain number of tests
	  and track the performance over time.
