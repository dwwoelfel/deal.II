    <h2>Information on development with <acronym>deal.II</acronym></h2>

    <p>
    Apart from the online API references and the tutorial, which ic
    covered elsewhere, this page gathers some information that might
    be of interest if you want to develop programs based on
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, we have the following resources available:
    </p>

    <ul> 
    <li> <p><a href="makefiles.html" target="body">Makefiles</a>:
         The library has a file which exports several make variables
	 to Makefiles which include it. This information may be used
         to make writing Makefiles more portable and simple. The
	 exported variables are explained in this page and we show two
	 generic Makefiles, one for small and one for larger projects.
         </p>

    <li> <p><a href="writing-documentation.html" target="body">Writing
         documentation</a>: To document the library and our
         application programs, we use a slightly patches version of
	 <a href="http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ssk/kde/kdoc/" target="_top">kdoc</a>
         which is one of the documentation tools of the
	 <a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_top">KDE</a>
         project. This page documents the basics of the format in
         which the documentation needs to be written in order to
         enable automatic documentation generation.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="../porting.html" target="body">Porting
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new system</a>:
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses the mechanism provided by
         GNU&nbsp;autoconf. Therefore, porting to a reasonably
         standardized UNIX system should not be too difficult. Other
         systems, such as proprietary one, might or might not work;
         see the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
         file for more information on supported systems and porting.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="recent-changes.html" target="body">Recent changes to
         the library</a>: If you want to stay informed about what is
         going on with the library itself, your may want to take a
         look at the page where we have some information about
	 recent changes to the library.
