    <h1>Information on development with <acronym>deal.II</acronym></h1>

    <p>
    Apart from the online API references and the tutorial, which is
    covered elsewhere, this page gathers some information that might
    be of interest if you want to develop programs based on
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> yourself, or if you want to contribute
    to the development of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> itself. In the
    latter case, we encourage you to get anonymous subversion access as
    described on our <a
    href="http://www.dealii.org/download/">download page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, we have the following resources available:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> <p> Documentation of the <a href="svn.html">SVN Archive</a>.</p>


    <li> <p><a href="makefiles.html" target="body">Makefiles</a>:
         The library has a file which exports several make variables
	 to Makefiles which include it. This information may be used
         to make writing Makefiles more portable and simple. The
	 exported variables are explained in this page and we show two
	 generic Makefiles, one for small and one for larger projects.
         </p>

    <li> <p><a href="writing-documentation.html" target="body">Writing
         documentation</a>: To document the library and our
         application programs, we use
	 <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>.
         This page documents the basics of the format in
         which the documentation needs to be written in order to
         enable automatic documentation generation.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="../porting.html" target="body">Porting
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new system</a>:
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses the mechanism provided by
         GNU&nbsp;autoconf. Therefore, porting to a reasonably
         standardized UNIX system should not be too difficult. Other
         systems, such as proprietary ones, might or might not work (it is
	 possible, for example, to use Microsoft Windows);
         see the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
         file for more information on supported systems and porting.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/dealii" target="_top">Bugs</a>:
         Though well tested, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> certainly has
         bugs. If you want to report a bug (or enhancement request),
         go to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/dealii"
         target="_top">bug tracking system</a> and enter a new ticket
         for your issue.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="testsuite.html" target="body">Running the testsuite</a>:
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a testsuite that we run to
         make sure that our tests don't break any existing
         functionality. This page explains its use.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="../doxygen/deal.II/CodingConventions.html"
         target="body">Coding conventions</a>: We try to adhere to a
         set of coding conventions to ensure that the use of different
         parts of the library is as uniform as possible. Please read
         through them if you think about contributing code.
  </ul>

  Finally, here are a few pages that are automatically generated. Note
  that these references point to a global copy on our web server, not
  to in your local directory:
  <ul>
    <li> <p><a href="http://www.dealii.org/changelogs/index.html"
         target="body">Recent changes to the library</a>: If you want to stay
         informed about what is going on with the library itself, you may want
         to take a look at this page where we have some information about
         recent changes to the library. You can browse the repository and
         subscribe to an rss feed too.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a
         href="http://www.dealii.org/~archiver/cgi-bin/regression_quick.pl"
         target="body">Results of regression tests:</a> Every night,
         the regression tests are run on some of our machines. The log of the
         results can be seen here.
	 </p>

    <li> <p><a href="http://www.dealii.org/~archiver/cgi-bin/build.pl">
	  Results of build tests:</a> We also build the library each night on
	  a variety of computers, using different compilers. The results of
	  these builds is listed as well.
	 </p>
    </ul>
