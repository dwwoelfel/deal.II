    <h2>Information on development with <acronym>deal.II</acronym></h2>

    <p>
    Apart from the online API references and the tutorial, which ic
    covered elsewhere, this page gathers some information that might
    be of interest if you want to develop programs based on
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, we have the following resources available:
    </p>

    <ul> 
    <li> <p><a href="makefiles.html" target="body">Makefiles</a>:
         The library has a file which exports several make variables
	 to Makefiles which include it. This information may be used
         to make writing Makefiles more portable and simple. The
	 exported variables are explained in this page and we show two
	 generic Makefiles, one for small and one for larger projects.
         </p>

    <li> <p><a href="recent-changes.html" target="body">Recent changes to
         the library</a>: If you want to stay informed about what is
         going on with the library itself, your may want to take a
         look at the page where we have some information about
	 recent changes to the library.
