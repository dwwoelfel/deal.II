    <h1>The <acronym>DEAL</acronym> Tutorial</h1>
    
    <h2>or <acronym>DEAL</acronym> in several easy and some more hard lessons</h2>
    
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial is written in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40">HTML
	4.0</a> which your browser may or may not support. If you run into problems
      you are advised to try a recent browser or one that is able to parse Document
      Type Definitions. The reason for this is the math support of HTML 4.0. Most
      people should, however, not run into any
      problems.</p>
    <p>
      You yourself should have some background knowledge on numerical methods, finite 
      elements and C++.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage of this document</h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial is split into several parts, starting with the stationary
      Laplace problem and advancing to more complicated problems. If you have never
      used <acronym>DEAL</acronym> we recommend that you begin at the beginning and
      advance through the chapters in their proper order. This tutorial contains the
      complete code for every example program and can be used as a reference, too,
      if you are looking for code to solve a specific problem with
      <acronym>DEAL</acronym>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>On <acronym>DEAL</acronym></h3>
    <p>
      <acronym>DEAL</acronym> is short for Differential Equations Analysis Library,
      which says it all, really. Its purpose it the solution of partial differential
      equations on unstructured grids with error control. You can find more
      information on <acronym>DEAL</acronym> and some examples at 
      <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/DEAL/">
	http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/DEAL/</a>. <acronym>DEAL</acronym> was written 
      by the numerics group at the IWR, University of Heidelberg.
    </p>
    
    <h3><a href="tutorial/01.laplace/index.html">Chapter 1: The Laplace
	problem</a></h3>
    <p>
      We will solve the stationary Laplace problem on a square grid with zero
      boundary condition on three of the edges and a constant boundary condition on
      one edge.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical terms</h3>
    <p> 
      There is a <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> available to explain technical terms.
