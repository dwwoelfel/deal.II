    <h1>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>: A Finite Element <em>D</em>ifferential
    <em>E</em>quations <em>A</em>nalysis <em>L</em>ibrary
    </h1>

    <h2>What is <acronym>deal.II</acronym>?</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is a C++ program library targeted at
    adaptive finite elements and error estimation. It uses
    state-of-the-art programming techniques of the C++ programming
    language to offer you a modern interface to the complex data
    structures and algorithms required for adaptivity and enables you
    to use a variety of finite elements in one, two, and three space
    dimensions, as well as time-dependent problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    The main aim of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is to enable
    development of modern finite element algorithms, using among other
    aspects sophisticated error estimators and adaptive
    meshes. Writing such programs is a non-trivial task, and
    successful programs tend to become very large and complex. We
    therefore believe that this is best done using a program library
    that frees the application programmer from aspects like grid
    handling and refinement, handling of degrees of freedom, input
    of meshes and output of results in graphics formats, and the
    like. Also, support for several space dimensions at once is
    included in a way such that programs can be written independent of
    the space dimension without unreasonable penalties on run-time and
    memory consumption. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> emerged from work at the
    <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
    Numerical Methods Group</a> of the University of Heidelberg,
    Germany, which is at the forefront of adaptive finite element
    methods and error estimators. It is presently developed in
    Heidelberg, at the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology
    of the <a href="http://www.dlr.de">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a> in
    Braunschweig, and at the <a
    href="http://www.ticam.utexas.edu">Texas Institute of
    Computational and Applied Mathematics (TICAM)</a> in Austin,
    Texas.  It is used in several large research projects around the
    world. <acronym>deal.II</acronym> presently has about 200,000
    lines of code and has several hundred users around the world.
    </p>


    <h2>What <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can offer you</h2>

    <p>
    If you are active in the field of adaptive finite element methods,
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> might be the right library for your
    projects. Among other features, it offers:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> <p>
         Support for one, two, and three space dimensions, using a
         unified interface that allows to write programs almost
         dimension independent.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Handling of locally refined grids, including different adaptive
	 refinement strategies based on local error indicators and
         error estimators.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for a variety of finite elements, including Lagrange
         elements of order one through four, discontinuous
         elements, Nedelec elements, and elements composed of other elements.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Extensive documentation: all documentation is available online
	 in a logical tree structure to allow fast access to the information
	 you need. If printed it comprises more than 400 pages of tutorials,
         several reports, and presently some 3,800 pages of programming
         interface documentation with explanations of all classes,
         functions, and variables. All documentation comes with the
         library and is available online locally on your computer after
         installation.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Modern software techniques that make access to the complex
         data structures and algorithms as transparent as possible.
	 The use of object oriented programming allows for program
	 structures similar to the structures in mathematical analysis.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Fast algorithms that enable you to solve problems with
         up to several millions of degrees of freedom quickly.
	 As opposed to programming symbolic algebra packages the penalty
	 for readability is low.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for several output formats, including many common
         formats for visualization of scientific data.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for a variety of computer platforms. On
         multiprocessor machines, many operations are parallelized.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Free source code under an Open Source license, and the
         invitation to contribute to further development of the
         library.
	 </p>
    </ul>


    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has quite extensive online
    documentation, so we dedicated a
    <a href="documentation.html" target="body">separate
    page on documentation</a> to this subject.
    </p>


    <p>
    Those parts of the online documentation that are most often
    accessed are the API references. For your convenience, they are
    also listed in the navigation panel on the left.

    TARGET="_top">DEAL</a>, developed by Guido Kanschat, Franz-Theo
    Suttmeier, and Roland Becker. This library is now being maintained
    and developed by Franz-Theo Suttmeier at the University of
