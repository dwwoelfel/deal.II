    <h2>What is <acronym>deal.II</acronym>?</h2>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is a C++ program library targeted at
    adaptive finite elements and error estimation. It uses
    state-of-the-art programming techniques of the C++ programming
    language to offer you a modern interface to the complex data
    structures and algorithms required for adaptivity and enables you
    to use a variety of finite elements in one, two, and three space
    dimensions, as well as time-dependent problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    The main aim of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is to enable
    development of modern finite element algorithms, using among other
    aspects sophisticated error estimators and adaptive
    meshes. Writing such programs is a non-trivial task, and
    successful programs tend to become very large and complex. We
    therefore believe that this is best done using a program library
    that frees the application programmer from aspects like grid
    handling and refinement, handling of degrees of freedom, input
    of meshes and output of results in graphics formats, and the
    like. Also, support for several space dimensions at once is
    included in a way such that programs can be written independent of
    the space dimension without unreasonable penalties on run-time and
    memory consumption. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> emerged from the work at the
    <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
    Numerical Methods Group</a> of the University of Heidelberg, which
    is at the forefront of adaptive finite element methods and error
    estimators. It is used in several large research projects in
    Heidelberg and elsewhere.
    </p>


    <h2>What <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can offer you</h2>

    <p>
    If you are active in the field of adaptive finite element methods,

    projects. Among other features, it offers:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li> <p>
         Support for one, two, and three space dimensions, using a
         unified interface that enables writing programs almost
         dimension independent.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Handling of locally refined grids, including algorithms to
         adaptively refine them, using error indicators and
         estimators.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for a variety of finite elements, including Lagrange
         elements of order one through four, and discontinuous
         elements. 
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Extensive documentation: about 200 pages of tutorials,
         several reports, and far more than 1,000 pages of programming
         interface documentation with explanations of all classes,
         functions, and variables.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Modern software techniques that make access to the complex
         data structures and algorithms as transparent as possible.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Fast algorithms that enable you to solve problems with
         up to several millions of degrees of freedom quickly.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for several output formats, including some common
         formats for visualisation of scientific data.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Support for a variety of computer platforms, including
         multiprocessor machines.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>

         invitation to contribute to further development of the
         library.
	 </p>
    </ul>


    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories:
    <ul>
    <li> <p>The <a href="readme.html" target="body">README</a> file of
         the library. It gives information on system requirements,
         installation, and copyright.</p>

    <li> <p>The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>:
         for new users of the library. It
         explains the basic elements of finite element programs based
         on the library, and provides small example programs.</p>

    <li> <p> If you plan to
         <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">develop 
         your own applications</a>  using
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
	 at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
         page</a>.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>Programming interface documentation: the classes and methods
         in the library are extensively documented (presently
         approximately 1250 pages if printed). This API documentation
         is split into several parts, according 
	 to the sub-libraries and the different directories of the main
	 <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
	 <ul>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/base/index.html" target="body">
                 <code>/base</code> library</a>: a set of classes not
                 specifically related to finite elements, but
                 nonetheless important for the overall library,
