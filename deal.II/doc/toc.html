    <h2>Online documentation</h2>

    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has quite extensive online
    documentation, which falls into several categories:
    <ul>
    <li> <p>The <a href="readme.html" target="body">README</a>
         file of the library: this file explains installation,
         required programs and some other topics.</p>

    <li> <p>The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>:
         we have a tutorial for new users of the library which
         explains the basic elements of finite element programs based
         on the library, and provides some small example programs.</p>

    <li> <p> In case you want to 
         <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">develop 
         your own applications</a>  using
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, it might be worth to take a look
	 at <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">this
         page</a> which has some information regarding that subject.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>Programming interface documentation: the classes and methods
         in the library are extensively documented (presently
         approximately 1250 pages if printed). We write this
         documentation directly into the source code, which makes it
         much easier to keep it up to date, and use automatic tools to
         extract it into HTML or into printable formats. 
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 This API documentation is split into several parts, according
	 to the sublibraries and the different directories of the main
	 <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
	 <ul>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/base/index.html" target="_top">
                 <code>/base</code> library</a>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/lac/index.html" target="_top">
                 <code>/lac</code> library</a>
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/grid/index.html" target="_top">
	        Grid handling</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/dof/index.html" target="_top">
	        Degrees of freedom and finite elements</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library
	   <li> <a href="auto/kdoc/numerics/index.html" target="_top">
	        Numerical tools</a> in the 
                 <code>/deal.II</code> library
	 </ul>
	 </p>

    <li> <p> We have a few reports written on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
         the following of which are online:
	 <ul>
	 <li> A <a href="reports/deal.II-paper/index.html" target="body">
	      paper describing the background, purpose and methods</a>
	      of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, by Wolfgang Bangerth and
	      Guido Kanschat. This paper is also available as preprint
	      99-43 from the 
	      <a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de" target="_top">
	      IWR preprint server</a>.
	 <li> A brief report about the class involved in the
	      <a href="reports/class-hierarchies/index.html">iterators</a>
	      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
	      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
	      degrees of freedom, data values, etc.
	 </ul>
	 </p>

    <li> <p> Finally, we have a page where we list our
         <a href="future.html" target="body">plans for extensions of deal.II in
         the future</a>.

    <H2>Authors</H2>

    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> was originally designed and written by
    <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~wolf/" target="_top">Wolfgang
    Bangerth</a>, starting in early 1998; he is still maintaining and
    managing the library, contributing code, and writing
    documentation. However, over time 
    other people have contributed as well, most notably 
    <a href="http://gaia.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~kanschat/" target="_top">Guido
    Kanschat</a>, who wrote much of the code linking several finite elements
    together into one and above all the largest part of the multigrid
    code. In addition, the first author owes him many thanks for
    continuous advice in the early implementation stages on questions
    of what is necessary to make up a good finite element code; only
    this flow of advice made if possible to design from scratch a
    library with the flexibility and stability of the interface of
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>.
