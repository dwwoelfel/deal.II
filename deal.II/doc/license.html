  <h1><acronym>deal.II</acronym>-license for non-commercial use</h1>

  <p>
  For non-commercial purposes, the
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library has been placed under an Open Source
  license, in the sense advocated by the 
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source
  Initiative</a>. You are thus free to copy and use it, and you have
  free access to all source codes. However, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
  is not in the public domain, it is property of the
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors. Some parts of the library are by other
  persons, and are marked with their names. Also, note that parts of
  the files in the <code>contrib/</code> subdirectory are by other
  people, and are distributed under separate licenses; in particular,
  you will find parts of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">BOOST</a>
  library in this directory, and deal.II comes with a copy of <a
  href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/" target="_top">UMFPACK</a>
  and one of <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~warp/FunctionParser/" target="_top">FunctionParser</a>, courtesy of their authors. UMFPACK and FunctionParser
  are covered by their own licenses; please  refer to the
  <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/" target="_top">UMFPACK</a> and
  <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~warp/FunctionParser/" target="_top">FunctionParser</a> 
  webpages to read them. The files of these external libraries are not part of
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, but are only distributed together;
  please refer to the webpages of these projects for further
  information on license questions. In particular, if you do not agree
  with the conditions of the licenses of these external libraries, you
  may not use these components of our distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is distributed under the Q Public License
  (or "QPL"), which qualifies as an <a
  href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html" target="_top">Open Source
  license</a>. It is thus appropriate for people wishing to write
  software under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org"
  target="_top">Open Source</a> model where all source code to the
  software is made available to all users and can be freely modified
  and redistributed. QPL was originally developed by
  <a href="http://www.troll.no" target="_top">Troll Tech</a> for their
  Qt program library, but has since gained some support by other
  library authors as well.
  </p>

  <p>
  The QPL prohibits development of proprietary software. If you intend
  to develop commercial software based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
  we are willing to negotiate a suitable agreement. Feel free to
  contact us in this case.
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>


  <p>
  In addition to the terms imposed by the QPL, we have one restriction
  on the use of the library:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Every publication presenting numerical results obtained with
       the help of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> shall state the name of
       the library and its principal authors (at present Wolfgang
       Bangerth, Guido Kanschat and Ralf Hartmann), as well as cite at
       least one of
       the papers by these authors on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. This
       is the usual, fair way of giving credits to contributors to a
       scientific result, and using a complex programming environment
       like <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should be considered a
       significant contribution.
  </ul>

  <p>
  In this document, as well as in the program files, the terms
  <i>authors of <acronym>deal.II</acronym></i> and
  <i><acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors</i> generally refer to the
  principal authors of the library. These are presently Wolfgang
  Bangerth, Guido Kanschat and Ralf Hartmann.
  </p>

  <p>
    
  Please note that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface with a number of <a
  href="readme.html#external-libs">other packages</a> that you have to install
  yourself. They are, of course, covered by their own licenses.
