  <ol>
    <li><strong>When <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is Open Source, can I use it to make
                commercial (proprietary) software?</strong>
        <p>
        <em>No.</em>
	</p>

        <p>
	You will still need to obtain a profesional version of
	<acronym>deal.II</acronym> from the authors to make commercial
	(proprietary) software with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
	(unless, as always, you release software as free/Open Source
	software).
        </p>


    <li><strong>I want to put <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, and
                applications that use it, on a CD-ROM or on a web
                site. Can I do that with the Free Edition?</strong>
	<p>
        <em>Yes.</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	You may copy and redistribute <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, both
	at home and at work, without restrictions.

The license is called the Q Public License (or
"QPL"), and qualifies as an 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html" target="_top">Open Source
license</a>. It is 
thus appropriate for people wishing to write software under the 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source</a>
model where all source
code to the software is made available to all users and can be freely
modified and redistributed. <p> The QPL prohibits development of
proprietary software. For Qt our <a href="/pricing.html">Qt Professional
Edition</a> product is available for this.

be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
<p>
c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
