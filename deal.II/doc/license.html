  <h1><acronym>deal.II</acronym>-license for non-commercial use</h1>

  <p>
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is placed under an Open Source license,
  in the sense advocated by the 
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source
  Initiative</a>. You are thus free to copy and use it, and you have
  free access to all source codes. However, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
  is not in the public domain, it is property of the
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors.
  </p>

  <p>
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is distributed under the Q Public License
  (or "QPL"), which qualifies as an <a
  href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html" target="_top">Open Source
  license</a>. It is thus appropriate for people wishing to write
  software under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org"
  target="_top">Open Source</a> model where all source code to the
  software is made available to all users and can be freely modified
  and redistributed. The QPL was originally developed by
  <a href="http://www.troll.no" target="_top">Troll Tech</a> for their
  Qt program library, but has since gained some support by other
  library authors as well.
  </p>

  <p>
  The QPL prohibits development of proprietary software. If you intend
  to develop commercial software based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>,
  we are willing to negotiate a suitable agreement. Feel free to
  contact us in this case.
  </p>

  <p>
  For more information on the QPL, please see also the following

  </p>


  <p>
  In addition to the terms imposed by the QPL, we have one restriction
  on the use of the library:
  <ul>
  <li> Every publication presenting numerical results obtained with
       the help of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> shall state the name of
       the library and its principle authors (at present Wolfgang
       Bangerth and Guido Kanschat), as well as cite at least one of
       the papers by these authors on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. This
       is the usual, fair way of giving credits to contributors to a
       scientific result, and using a complex programming environment
       like <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should be considered a
       significant contribution.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  In this document, as well as in the program files, the terms
  <i>authors of <acronym>deal.II</acronym></i> and
  <i><acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors</i> generally refer to the
  principle authors of the library. These are presently Wolfgang
  Bangerth and Guido Kanschat.
