    <h1>Installation instructions for Borland'c C++ 5.7</h1>

    <p>
    This compiler is not supported yet, or maybe we should say this
    differently: this compiler has a lot of quirks which makes it reject
    the library at too many places for us to find workarounds. It has a number
    of problems which seem to happen randomly -- trying to cut down on the code
    makes them go away, so that it is hard to come up with short testcases.
    </p>

    <p>
    Roughly estimated, there may be about 5 to 10 bugs in the compiler that
    prevent it to compile the library. I think one can say that it is close,
    but not there yet.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, the compiler is detected by the configuration machinery, so
    testing newer versions of the compiler should be simple once they are
    released. Borland C++ 5.7 is part of both Borland's Windows C++ compiler
    kit as well as the Kylix3 environment for Linux.
