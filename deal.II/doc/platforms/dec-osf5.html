    <h1>Installation instructions for DEC OSF1 V5.x</h1>

    <p>
    Installation on DEC (now Compaq) OSF1 succeeded mostly for compilation with
    both gcc2.95 and cxx version 6.3. Some issues remain:
    <ul>
    <li> <p>
         We were not able to create functional shared libraries with
         cxx; this is most probably due to wrong compilation and link
         flags and should be solvable by someone with experience with
         cxx.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Using static libraries and cxx, the step-4 example program
         can not be linked. This is due to the fact that it links to
         the libraries for both 2d and 3d, and the linker reports
         conflicts for multiply defined symbols
         <code>__init_sti__tria_cc_776f5f60</code>. These are actually
         functions automatically generated by the compiler and used to
         initialize the static data objects in the file
         <code>tria.cc</code>. As the compiler seems to select the
         name of this automatically generated function only based on
         the file name, it chooses the same name in both the 2d and
         the 3d library, which results in the clash. In effect this
         means that it is impossible to link programs statically
         against libraries for more than one space dimension at a
         time. We do not know how to teach the compiler to choose
         names differently.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         When compiled with gcc2.95, the step-4 example programs goes
         into an infinite loop, at the very end of the program, even
         after the destructors for the two objects in the main
         functions have run. Having no access to a debugger, the cause
         is unknown.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         The step-5 example program crashes right after start when
         compiled with both gcc2.95 and cxx6.3. The cause is unknown.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         In general there seem to be programs that hang after execution
         (but are not stopped, they actually need computing time). The
         cause is unknown.
	 </p>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    To use one or the other compiler, you have to set the
    <code>CXX</code> environment variable to either <code>g++</code>
    or <code>cxx</code>. If it is not set, the configuration scripts
    seems to take <code>g++</code> as compiler. Please also set the
    <code>CC</code> environment variable to a corresponding C
    compiler.
    </p>
