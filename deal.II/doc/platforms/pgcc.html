    <h1>Installation instructions for the Portland Group pgcc compiler</h1>

    <p>
    This compiler is not supported yet, or maybe we should say this
    differently: this compiler does not support C++ enough to allow
    compilation of the library. The first obstacle is that as of
    version 3.3-2, the compiler does not come with C++ style headers
    <code>&lt;cmath&rt;</code>, <code>&lt;cstdlib&rt;</code>, etc. If
    such a file is placed into the respective include directory,
    containing in include statement for the respective C style header
    (no "c" in front, but a ".h" at the end), then at least the
    preprocessor works, but we are stuck with uses of the math
    functions in namespace "std", such as <code>std::sin</code>. This
    would require changes all over the code, or writing a standard
    compliant header file, both of which we are not willing to do as
    this is just a lack of C++ conformance of the compiler, not of the
    library.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, even if we do this in a couple of places, we get
    consistent errors with this perfectly legal piece of code:
    <code>
    <pre>
#include <map>

void g (double);
void f() 
{
  std::map<int,double> m;
  for (std::map<int,double>::const_iterator i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); ++i)
    g(i->second);
};
    </pre>
    </code>
    leading to this message:
    <code>
    <pre>
tmp/x> pgCC -c x.cc
"x.cc", line 8: error: expression must have pointer type
      g(i->second);
        ^

1 error detected in the compilation of "x.cc".
    </pre>
    </code>
    </p>

    <p>
    Furthermore, we consistently got this error:
    <code>
    <pre>
"/home/wolf/p/deal.II/3/deal.II/base/include/base/memory_consumption.h", line 482: internal error:
          assertion failed at: "../src/types.c", line 4669

    unsigned int memory_consumption (const T (&v)[N])
                 ^

1 catastrophic error detected in the compilation of "source/data_out_base.cc".
Compilation aborted.
pgCC-Fatal-/home/wolf/bin/pgcc/linux86/bin/pgcpp1 TERMINATED by signal 6
    </pre>
    </code>
    At this point we thought we'd better use our time for something
    better and wait for the next version of the compiler.
    </p>
