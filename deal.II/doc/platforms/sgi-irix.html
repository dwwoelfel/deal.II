    <h1>Installation instructions for SGI IRIX</h1>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> works without problems with shared
    libraries on this platform, if you list the path
    <code>$D/lib</code> in your <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
    environment variable, where <code>$D</code> is the path to your
    installation of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library. The
    necessary actions can be done with the commands
    <pre>
    <code>
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $D/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    </code>
    </pre>
    for csh-like shells, or by
    <pre>
    <code>
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$D/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    </code>
    </pre>
    if you use the ``bash'' shell. Please substitute <code>$D</code>
    by whatever is the appropriate path on your installation.
    </p>

    <p>
    These actions are necessary, since on SGI IRIX it seems not
    possible to link a program to a shared library by giving the full
    path of the latter. On all other systems where we use shared
    libraries, the full path to the shared library is given on the
    command line and stored somewhere in the executable, so that the
    linker finds the library irrespective of the fact that the path is
    specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or not. However, on SGI IRIX, as it
    seems, only the library's name, not its path seems to be stored in
    the executable, so LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to be modified.
    </p>

    <p>
    We note that this might lead to problems if, for whatever reason,
    you have multiple versions of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> installed
    and compiled with different flags; then, to ensure that you link
    to the correct library at execution time, you will have to
    redefine LD_LIBRARY_PATH before execution of your program. Another
    possibility would be to used statically linked libraries instead
    of shared ones (see the 
    <a href="../readme.html#configuration-options" target="body">ReadMe</a> file to
    find out how to do that).
    </p>

    <p>
    When compiling <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with the MIPSpro
    compiler in 64-bit mode it is necessary to
    <pre>
    <code>
      setenv CXXFLAGS -64
      setenv LDFLAGS -64
    </code>
    </pre>
    before calling <code>./configure</code>.
    Furthermore, the <code>$LD_LIBRARY64_PATH</code> (instead of the
    <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>) environment variable needs to be set
    <pre>
    <code>
      setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH $D/lib:$LD_LIBRARY64_PATH
    </code>
    </pre>
    On ``bash'' shells use the <code>export</code> command accordingly.
    </p>
