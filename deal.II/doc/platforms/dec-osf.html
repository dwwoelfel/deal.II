    <h1>Installation instructions for DEC OSF1 V4.0</h1>


    <h2>Using DEC's cxx compiler</h2>

    <p>
    We have also made preliminary tests with DEC's cxx compiler,
    version 6.0, on a OSF1 V4.0 system. This compiler seems to be
    rather conformant and discovered a number of places where we
    involuntarily seem to have used gcc's sloppyness. These are of
    course fixed now. The largest
    drawback was that version 6.0 of the compiler did not yet know
    about the standard C++ headers <code>cmath</code>,
    <code>cstdlib</code>, etc, which are included instead of
    <code>math.h</code>, <code>stdlib.h</code>, etc. Otherwise there
    did not seem unsurmountable obstacles to the use of that
    compiler. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, we were not able to test the library further on that
    system, so there may still be a number of places that
    need minor fixes.
    </p>



    <h2>Using gcc as compiler</h2>

    <p>
    We have tried to compile <acronym>deal.II</acronym> on DEC Alpha
    workstations under OSF1 V4.0. The main problem seems to be that on
    this operating system, that the GNU BinUtils are not supported, so
    we have to use the system assembler. That, however, has a built-in
    limit for the size of symbol names, which is quickly exceeded in
    the template-heavy parts of the code. Typical error messages from
    the assembler therefore spill out several pages of symbols with an
    interspersed note that that symbol exceeded the maximum line
    length of the assembler.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, when using gcc2.95 or previous versions or gcc
    there seems no real way to avoid this. Later versions of gcc will
    use a different scheme (called <em>squangling</em>, an
    amalgamation of <em>squeezing</em> and <em>mangling</em>) to mangle C++
    names into symbol names that generate shorter symbols. However,
    this scheme is not readily available on gcc2.95. However, if you
    are willing to recompile and reinstall gcc, you can switch on the
    squangling scheme by slighly modifying one of gcc's source
    files. The full details of this are listed
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/41.html" target="_top">on 
    this page</a>. With this scheme switched on, we were able to
    compile the library.
    </p>

    <p>
    Problems do not end here, though. The system assembler, due to its
    limited line length, also rejects long lines of debugging
    information. We avoid this by not using the -ggdb switch of gcc,
    but rather use -gstabs. This generates less debugging information,
    but the lines are also shorter, so the assembler can digest
    them. However, you should be aware that this can, in some cases,
    reduce your ability to debug programs, due to missing information
    in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, the system's ``ar'' program seems to have a limit that
    does not allow it to generate some of the libraries; in debug
    mode, three sublibraries (one for 1d, 2d, and 3d, each) have a
    size of more than 40 MB, and the system ``ar'' errored out with
    the following message:
    <pre>
      ar: Warning: creating lib/libdeal_II_2d.g.a
      /: write failed, file system is full
      ar:  error writing archive member contents: Bad file number
      gmake: *** [lib/libdeal_II_2d.g.a] Error 1
    </pre>
    However, it is not true that there is no left space on that
    device. Furthermore, it is funny that ``ar'' warns about an action
    that it is told to do. The solution is to install GNU ar from the
    GNU binutils package, which is available for the OSF operating
    system as well, even though the GNU assembler gas is not. With GNU
    ar installed, linking object files together to libraries went fine.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another problem occured when gcc generated an internal compiler
    error when compiling the AssertThrow macro. (Note that we have
    also observed this effect on DEC Alpha stations running Linux
    instead of OSF.) In order to avoid this problem, on systems where
    this happens we changed the behaviour of this macro to simply
    abort the program, instead of throwing an exception. This then
    does not allow you to catch exceptions that are generated on other
    systems, but it was the only way we were able to make the compiler
    work. If anyone should have a better idea, we would be eager to
    hear about it.
    </p>

    <p>
    The decisions to use -gstabs over -ggdb, and whether the
    AssertThrow macro works correctly are done at configure time, and
    are not hard-coded into the library. Thus, if your system has a
    patch for the system assembler installed that allows it to accept
    longer debugging information lines, or if your compiler accepts
    the AssertThrow macro, then the restrictions above do not
    apply. If you install a patch to the assembler or the compiler to
    avoid these problems, re-configure the deal.II library and
    re-compile it for the changes to take full effect.
    </p>


    <p>
    As a last note: we have experienced link problems when using the
    ``squangle'' scheme of the compiler, with version 2.95.2 of the
    gcc compiler. The resulting error messages look like this:
    <pre>
      /usr/bin/ld:
      Unresolved:
      type_info::operator==(type_info const &) const
      collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    </pre>
    These errors are due to the fact that the function
    <code class="member">type_info::operator==(const typeinfo &)</code>
    can be squangled into the two strings
    <code class="member">__eq__C9type_infoRC9type_info</code> and
    <code class="member">__eq__C9type_infoRCB0</code> alike, with the
    same meaning. The latter uses a ``back-reference'' to denote the
    parameter with the same type as the class (this is the ``B0''
    part, identifying the parameter type with the class type), while
    the first version explicitely lists the parameter type. Of course,
    the compiler should be consistent in what version it generates,
    but it is not, unfortunately.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is possible to work around this bug in the compiler by the
    following small hack, which you have to compile and link in with
    all programs that use the
    <code class="member">type_info::operator==(const typeinfo &)</code>
    function:
    <pre>
      extern "C" {
        int __eq__C9type_infoRC9type_info (void *x1, void *x2);
        int __eq__C9type_infoRCB0 (void *x1, void *x2) {
          return __eq__C9type_infoRC9type_info(x1,x2);
        };
      };
    </pre>
    Note that the ``step-7'' example program uses this operator, and
    therefore needs to be linked with this code
    snippet. Alternatively, you can insert these lines into one of your
    source files, if you experience the problems described above.
    </p>
