    <h1>Installation instructions for Microsoft
           Windows 95/98/2000/NT</h1>

    <p>
    We have no such system to try, but we have been told that it is
    possible to use <acronym>deal.II</acronym> on Microsoft Windows
    systems as well, using either the CygWin or MingW environments
    that provide most of the Unix like features for the Windows system
    as well (such as ``perl'', or ``make''). You simply have to run the
    ``./configure'' script on the shell and follow the installation
    instructions in the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
    file.
    </p>

    <p>
    As far as we know, the only point to consider is that you
    can't use the ``make'' distributed with MingW, but have to
    use the GNU ``make'' from CygWin. If you should encounter other
    problems, we would love to hear about it and will try to provide
    fixes for them.
