    <h1>Installation instructions for Microsoft
           Windows 95/98/2000/NT/XP</h1>

    <p>
    It is possible to install <acronym>deal.II</acronym> on Microsoft Windows
    systems as well, using either the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> 
    or <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MingW</a> environments
    that provide most of the Unix like features for the Windows system
    as well (such as ``perl'', or ``make''). You simply have to run the
    ``./configure'' script on the shell and follow the installation
    instructions in the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
    file. Also, you need to include the <code>deal.II/lib</code> path in your PATH 
    environment variable (e.g. by editing your <code>.bash_profile</code> 
    file or the Windows registry).
    </p>

    <p>
    As far as we know, the only point to consider is that you
    can't use the ``make'' distributed with MingW, but have to
    use the GNU ``make'' from CygWin. If you should encounter other
    problems, we would love to hear about it and will try to provide
    fixes for them.
