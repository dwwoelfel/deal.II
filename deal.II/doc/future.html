    <h2>Plans for the future of deal.II</h2>

    <p>
    While we consider <acronym>deal.II</acronym> quite useful
    in the present form, there are still many things that we would
    like to implement in future versions. Among these are the following
    topics:
    <ul>
    <li> <p> <strong>Multigrid:</strong> We are working on an
         implementation of multigrid methods for
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. While this is running on globally
         refined grids, we are still having problems on locally
         refined meshes. For those, multigrid is only applicable with
         DG methods yet.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>The <I>hp</I>-method of finite elements:</strong>
	 Implementing this will need a class analogous to the
         <code>DoFHandler</code> class, as well as extensions to the finite
         element classes where descriptions of interface conditions to
         other finite elements on neighboring cells are needed. While
         the latter is straightforward, the first is a major
         task. We are presently working on this and hope to have something in
	 the near future for at least discontinuous elements.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More output formats:</strong>
	 It would be nice to have the possibility of writing output in
         more graphics formats. This is a simple task, since basically
         only two files have to be modified and the interface is very
         simple. In case you have an unsupported graphics program and
         a student with half a week spare time, this is the right
         project.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More example programs:</strong>
	 There are still many aspects of the library that are not yet
         covered by the example programs (in particular, on the list
         of things are the <code class="class">ParameterHandler</code>
         and <code class="class">SolutionTransfer</code> classes, 1d programs,
	 using the <code class="class">FilteredMatrix</code>
	 class). This is certainly 
         something that should be improved, but is rather time
         consuming.
	 </p>

    <li> <p> 
         <strong>A better test-suite:</strong> We have a
         suite of programs (approximately 430 programs with roughly
         58,000 lines of code at present) that are run automatically
         for regression tests each night. Some of these are modified real-life
         applications, so they should cover a relevant part of the
         library, and some others test certain parts of the library
         extensively, but it would be necessary to reach every corner of 
         the library to be sure a certain patch does not break
         something. Also, a complete test-suite for the library would
         be quite valuable for ports to new computer systems and
         compilers.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Documentation:</strong>
	 Printing the documentation is probably not what one would
         usually do anyway, due to the sheer size. However, it might
         be useful to print, for instance, the example programs. There
         might be more information worth printing in some cases which
         I presently can't think about.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 For these cases, it would be interesting to have them in
	 another format than HTML. We think that DocBook SGML would be
	 a good choice, since it can be converted into many other
	 formats, including printable ones and ones which can be
	 nicely displayed on the screen. This would require that some
	 document-generating scripts produce SGML instead of (or in
	 addition to) HTML, and some other tweaks, but is probably no
	 big deal. It just needs someone with appropriate knowledge.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Installation:</strong>
	 Some parts of the configure machinery and the installation
         process are not as simple as they should be. This should
         eventually be made better. The most outstanding example is
         the way we build shared libraries; for this, the
	 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html"
	 target="_top">libtool</a> utility may be a useful.
	 Help in the configuration of these things would be greatly
	 appreciated.
	 </p>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    We believe in an open development model and would like to
    encourage everyone to send us patches and extensions they have. We
    think that a cooperative effort can improve the library much more
    than a limited and closed circle of developers ever can. We are
    therefore eager to review contributions by others for inclusion
    into the library and to help in their development. Please feel
    free to contact us in such cases!
    </p>
