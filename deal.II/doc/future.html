    <h2>Plans for the future of deal.II</h2>

    <p>
    While we consider <acronym>deal.II</acronym> quite useful
    in the present form, there are still many things that we would
    like to implement in future versions. Among these are the following
    topics:
    <ul>
    <li> <p> <strong>Finite elements and mappings:</strong> Currently
         (Dez 00-Feb 01) we (Ralf Hartmann and Guido Kanschat) totally
         reimplement all finite elements and the mapping between the
         unit cell and the real cells. As result the Lagrange finite
         elements will be easily extendable to higher degree. E.g. for
         discontinous FEs we've already hardcoded Q1-Q10. Furthermore
         in future we won't be restricted to Q1 mapping as before, but
         we will have Qp mappings of arbitrary degree p. This allows
         to approximate curved boundaries not only by straight lines
         (linear approximation) but also by quadratic, cubic, etc
         approximation. The finite elements will be able to be
         combined with arbitrary mappings. So in future we can use
         subparametric, iso- as well as superparametric elements. Last
         but not least the new implementation will allow the use of
         non-conforming elements whose shape functions depend on the
         shape of the real cell (See item 'Non-conforming elements').
    	 </p>

    	 <p>
	 The new implementation uses a totally new structure of
	 communication between FEValues, the FiniteElements and the
	 Mappings. Despite of this the new structure will almost not be
	 'visible' to the user of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> as we try
	 to retain the interface to the user (mainly that of FEValues)
	 as far as possible.
    	 </p>

    	 <p>
	 This new functionality will be included in the next major
	 version of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Multigrid:</strong> We are working on an
         implementation of multigrid methods for
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. While this is running on globally
         refined grids, we are still having problems on locally
         refined grid. We hope to have them sorted out for the next
         major release.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Non-conforming elements:</strong> While
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is quite flexible with respect to
         the finite element to be used, it was written with Lagrange
         elements in mind. The basic problems in the implementation of
         other elements would therefore be the computation of shape
         function values if the shape functions depend on the shape of
         the cell. Since this is not the case for the usual continuous
         elements, the present implementation does not provide all
         information necessary for the computation of these values.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 In order to implement these elements, it would therefore be
	 necessary to review the interface between the
	 <code>FEValues</code> class and the
	 <code>FiniteElement</code> class. This would probably also be
	 the right time to further separate the implementation of the
	 mapping from unit to real cell from the actual finite element
	 code.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>The <I>hp</I>-method of finite elements:</strong>
	 Implementing this will need a class analogous to the
         <code>DoFHandler</code> class, as well as extensions to the finite
         element classes where descriptions of interface conditions to
         other finite elements on neighboring cells are needed. While
         the latter is probably straightforward, the first is a major
         task and is not planned for the immediate future. We would,
         however, offer advice if anyone wanted to implement this.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Linear solvers:</strong>
	 We already have the most common linear solvers, such as CG,
         BiCGStab, or Minres. However, there are certainly more
         proficient implementations of these solvers, but that would
         need experts in this field which we certainly are not. It
         would also be of interest to have linear solvers for more
         complicated applications.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Faster linear algebra:</strong>
	 The linear algebra implementation in
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is quite fast, but only compared
         to other C/C++ implementations. We know that Fortran
         compilers can do a much better job in optimizing the tight
         inner loops of matrix-vector operations. We plan to try
         interfaces from C to Fortran for that purpose.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More output formats:</strong>
	 It would be nice to have the possibility of writing output in
         more graphics formats. This is a simple task, since basically
         only two files have to be modified and the interface is very
         simple. In case you have an unsupported graphics program and
         a student with half a week spare time, this is the right
         project.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More example programs:</strong>
	 There are still many aspects of the library that are not yet
         covered by the example programs (in particular, on the list
         of things are the <code class="class">ParameterHandler</code>
         and <code class="class">SolutionTransfer</code> classes, the
         <code class="class">AssertThrow</code> macro, 1d programs,
	 curved boundaries and different mappings,
         and output of more than one variable). This is certainly
         something that should be improved, but is rather time
         consuming.
	 </p>

    <li> <p> 
         <strong>A better test-suite:</strong> We have a small
         suite of programs (approximately 40 programs with roughly
         15000 lines of code at present) that can be run automatically
         for regression tests. Some of these are modified real-life
         applications, so they should cover a relevant part of the
         library, but it would be necessary to reach every corner of
         the library to be sure a certain patch does not break
         something. Also, a complete test-suite for the library would
         be quite valuable for ports to new computer systems and
         compilers.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Documentation:</strong>
	 Printing the documentation is probably not what one would
         usually do anyway, due to the sheer size. However, it might
         be useful to print, for instance, the example programs. There
         might be more information worth printing in some cases which
         I presently can't think about.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 For these cases, it would be interesting to have them in
	 another format than HTML. We think that DocBook SGML would be
	 a good choice, since it can be converted into many other
	 formats, including printable ones and ones which can be
	 nicely displayed on the screen. This would require that some
	 document-generating scripts produce SGML instead (or in
	 addition) to HTML, and some other tweaks, but is probably no
	 big deal.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Installation:</strong>
	 Some parts of the configure machinery and the installation
         process are not as simple as they should be. This should
         eventually be made better. The most outstanding example is
         the way we build shared libraries; for this, the
	 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html"
	 target="_top">libtool</a> utility may be a help.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 Regarding shared and static libraries, there may also be
	 another open problem in that we don't call
	 <code>ranlib</code> on static libraries (or <code>ar
	 -s</code>). This has no particular reason, it is simply that
	 we don't know what is the right thing to do in a
	 cross-platform way. Help in the configuration of these things
	 would be greatly appreciated.
	 </p>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    We believe in an open development model and would like to
    encourage everyone to send us patches and extensions they have. We
    think that a cooperative effort can improve the library much more
    than a limited and closed circle of developers ever can. We are
    therefore eager to review contributions by others for inclusion
    into the library and to help in their development. Please feel
    free to contact us in such cases!
