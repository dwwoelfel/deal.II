    <h2>Plans for the future of deal.II</h2>

    <p>
    While we believe that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is quite usable
    in the present form, there are still many things that we would
    implement for future versions. Among these are the following
    topics:
    <ul>
    <li> <p>
         <strong>Multigrid:</strong> Guido Kanschat is working on an
         implementation of multigrid methods for
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. While this is running on globally
         refined grids, we are still having problems on locally
         refined grid. We hope to have them sorted out soon.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Non-conforming elements:</strong> While
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is quite flexible with respect to
         the finite element to be used, it was written with Lagrange
         elements in mind. The basic problems in the implementation of
         other elements would therefore be the computation of shape
         function values if the shape functions depend on the shape of
         the cell. Since this is not the case for the usual continuous
         elements, the present implementation does not provide all
         information necessary for the computation of these values.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 In order to implement these elements, it would therefore be
	 necessary to review the interface between the
	 <code>FEValues</code> class and the
	 <code>FiniteElement</code> class. This would probably also be
	 the right time to further separate the implementation of the
	 mapping from unit to real cell from the actual finite element
	 code.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Linear solvers:</strong>
	 We already have the most common linear solvers, such as CG,
         BiCGStab, or GMRES. However, there are certainly more
         proficient implementations of these solvers, but that would
         need experts in this field which we certainly are not. It
         would also be of interest to have linear solvers for more
         specialized applications; in particular, solvers for
         indefinite symmetric problems, such as MinRes or SymmLQ would
         be nice.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Faster linear algebra:</strong>
	 The linear algebra implementation in
         <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is quite fast, but only compared
         to other C/C++ implementations. We know that Fortran
         compilers can do a much better job in optimizing the tight
         inner loops of matrix-vector operations. We plan to try
         interfaces from C to Fortran for that purpose.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More output formats:</strong>
	 It would be nice to have the possibility of writing output in
         more graphics formats. This is a simple task, since basically
         only two files have to be modified and the interface is very
         simple. In case you have an unsupported graphics program and
         a student with half a week spare time, this is the right
         project.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>More example programs:</strong>
	 There are still many aspects of the library that are not yet
         covered by the example programs. This is certainly something
         that should be improved, but is time consuming.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Parallelization:</strong>
	 We do not presently think about parallelizing the libraries
         on distributed memory machines, but the present
         implementation of multithreading on shared memory machines is
         quite promising. We will implement multithreading for several
         other parts of the library of which we know they are taking
         significant amounts of time in common applications.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         <strong>Documentation:</strong>
	 Printing the documentation is probably not what one would
         usually do anyway, due to the sheer size. However, it might
         be useful to print, for instance, the example programs. There
         might be more information worth printing in some cases which
         I presently can't think about.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 For these cases, it would be interesting to have them in
	 another format than HTML. We think that DocBook SGML would be
	 a good choice, since it can be converted into many other
	 formats, including printable ones and ones which can be
	 nicely displayed on the screen. This would require that some
	 document-generating scripts produce SGML instead (or in
	 addition) to HTML, and some other tweaks, but is probably no
	 big deal.
	 </p>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    We believe in an open development model and would like to
    encourage everyone to send us patches and extensions they have. We
    think that a cooperative effort can improve the library much more
    than a limited and closed circle of developers ever can. We are
    therefore eager to review contributions by others for inclusion
    into the library and to help in their development. Please feel
    free to contact us in such cases!
