with  given initial  and  boundary conditions in   space and time often yields
discontinuous  solutions, usually  even if the   data are  smooth. Resolving
these  discontinuities without recourse to a globally refined  grid is a major
challenge,    especially in view   of  the fact  that   the same problems with
discontinuous solutions occur with other and more important equations as well,
such as the Euler equations of inviscid, eventually transonic flow.

Parameter estimation</A>

<P>
In many  applications in engineering,  one wants to determine   the value of a
parameter  from measurements.  One  example would  be  the estimation  of  the
elasticity parameters within  a  body  from measurements of   the displacement
under a specified load. Another similar problem would be the estimation of the
conductivity in  a porous  medium from  measurements of the  hydraulic
head. A prototypic elliptic equation would be

with some boundary conditions. The coefficient <I>q</I>(<I>x</I>) is to be determined
by minimizing the difference between the solution of this equation for a given
coefficient, <I>u</I><SUB><I>q</I></SUB>(<I>x</I>), and a measurement <I>u</I><SUB><I>meas</I></SUB>, by variation of <I>q</I>.

<P>
Problems of   this kind usually  are  ill-posed,  i.e. they  do  not possess a
continuous dependence of the optimal  parameter <IMG

from the  measurement
<I>u</I><SUB><I>meas</I></SUB>, which makes them rather difficult  to solve. Furthermore, they are
strongly  nonlinear and usually require many  solutions of the forward problem
(i.e. the  elliptic  equation for   a  fixed coefficient)   to determine   the
coefficient itself, which makes the efficient solution  of the forward problem
indispensable.

In Figure  <A HREF="node5.html#fig:parameter"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="/data/allarch/usr/latex2html/icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>  we show  two  examples of estimated parameters
along with the exact values.  In order to reduce  the degree of  ill-posedness
and to reduce the number of unknowns,  the discretization of the parameter <I>q</I>was performed on a  coarser grid than the  state  variable <I>u</I>.  In fact,  the
discretization was done on  the same grid but  we posed additional constraints
such that each patch of four cells  can be written as a  shape function on the
next  coarser grid;  these constraints can  then  be inserted  into the system
matrix just as was done for hanging nodes. The discretization of the parameter
was done  with discontinuous elements of one  degree lower than the polynomial
degree with which the state variable was discretized.

<P>
The top row of the picture shows the approximation of a continuous coefficient
on a square domain; the state variable was discretized with bilinear elements,
while the parameter was discretized with  discontinuous constant elements.  In
the bottom row, a discontinuous coefficient was to be  estimated on a circular
domain  of which one quarter  is shown; state and parameter variables
used bi-quadratic  continuous  elements and   discontinuous bilinear  elements,
respectively. No adaptive grid refinement was performed for the second case.

associated with suitable initial and boundary  conditions occurs in a variety of
places in physics, among which are water waves, acoustic sound waves in gaseous media,
electro-magnetics  and many other fields.  Usually,  <I>u</I> is the deviation from
the  state of   rest  and <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img47.gif"
 ALT="$\rho$">
and <I>a</I> denote  density and stiffness
coefficient.  The solutions of this equation often share the feature that they
form  waves   traveling through  the domain.  Often  the  region  where waves
presently  are is significantly  smaller than the  whole domain, so adaptivity
should be able to reduce  the number of cells needed  for the solution of this
equation by a noticeable amount, because coarse grids can  be used wherever no
waves are presently.

<P>
On the other hand, if we are not interested in the  whole solution but only in
parts of it  (say that part traveling in  one direction, or an  integral over
part of  the domain at  the end time), the  domain of influence of  the region
where we  evaluate itself also  often is significantly  smaller than the whole
region,  due  to  the finite speed  with  which  waves  spread.  Here  again a
reasonable reduction of the required number of cells can be obtained.

<P>
Typical  grids showing   this  are  presented  in   the following. They were
obtained using the program described in [<A
 HREF="node6.html#Ban98">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node6.html#BR99b">3</A>].  In  Figure

 SRC="/data/allarch/usr/latex2html/icons.gif/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, a wave traveling outward from the  lower left corner of the
domain is  shown. We used  a simple error  indicator to track the spreading of
the wave to adjust  the computational meshes accordingly; it  can be seen that
rather coarse cells were used where the solution is smooth.

Boundary approximation</A>
</H2>

<P>
In real-life applications such as air flow around a plane or
scattering of waves by objects, the computational boundaries
often are rather complex.  In particular, a coarse grid that already
mostly features the contours of the objects usually has many more
cells than is acceptable for a coarse grid. One way to avoid this
problem is to not approximate the boundary with the grid and pose
the boundary values on the boundary of the grid, but to use a mesh
that is not necessarily adapted to the physical boundaries and pose
boundary values in the weak form of the equation. This allows, among
other advantages, to use more regular meshes and a coarse grid with
less cells, which enables us to use efficient multigrid algorithms.

equation using Neumann boundary conditions on an embedded boundary
curve. The interior of the circle is not part of the domain on which
the problem is posed and the solution is set to zero there.
