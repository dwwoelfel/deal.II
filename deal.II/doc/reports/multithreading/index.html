  <h2>Multi-threading support in deal.II</h2>
  <h3>Wolfgang Bangerth, March 2000</h3>
</center>  

<DIR>
  In this report, we describe the implementational techniques of
  multi-threading support in deal.II, which we use for the
  parallelization of independent operations. Writing threaded programs in
  C++ is obstructed by two problems: operating system dependent
  interfaces and that these interfaces are created for C programs
  rather than for C++. We present our solutions to these problems and
  describe first experiences using multi-threading in deal.II.
