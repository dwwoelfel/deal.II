Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
We have shown how multi-threading is supported in <TT>deal.II</TT> and how it
can be used in several examples occuring in common finite element programs. It
was demonstrated that implementing a usable C++ interface poses several
difficulties, both from the aspect of user friendliness as well as program
correctness. In order to overcome these difficulties, first the more simple
framework implemented in <TT>deal.II</TT> version 3.0 was discussed, followed
by a rather complex scheme which will be the base of implementations in future
versions. 

<P>
The second framework features a more complicated hierarchy of classes as well
as intricate use of templates and synchronization mechanisms, which however
led to a design in which threads can be created in a user friendly, system
independent, C++ like way suitable for common programs. The use of this
framework is inherently safe and does not require special knowledge of the
internals by the user, and is simple to use.  By using it, the overhead
required for programming multi-threaded applications is reduced to a minimum
and the programmer can concentrate on the task of getting the semantics of
multi-threaded programs right, in particular managing concurrent access to
data and distributing work to different threads.

<P>
The framework has been used in several application programs and has shown that
with only marginally increased programming effort, finite element programs can
be made significantly faster on multi-processor machines.
