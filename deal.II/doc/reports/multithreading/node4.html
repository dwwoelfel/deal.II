Operating system dependence and ACE</A>
</H2>

<P>
While all relevant operating systems now support multi-threaded programs, they
all have different notions on what threads actually are on an operating system
level, how they shall be managed and created. Even on Unix systems, which are
usually well-standardized, there are at least three different and mutually
incompatible interfaces to threads: POSIX threads [<A
 HREF="node13.html#PosixThreads96">6</A>],
Solaris threads [<A
 HREF="node13.html#SolarisThreads92">5</A>], and Linux
threads. Some operating systems support more than one interface, but there is
no interface that is supported by all operating systems. Furthermore, other
systems like Microsoft Windows have interfaces that are incompatible to all
Unix systems [<A
 HREF="node13.html#Cus93">3</A>].

<P>
Writing multi-threaded programs based on the operating system interfaces is
therefore something inherently incompatible unless much effort is spent to
port it to a new system. To avoid this, we chose to use the ACE (Adaptive
Communication Environment, see [<A
 HREF="node13.html#Sch94">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node13.html#SW95">8</A>,<A
 HREF="node13.html#ACE">4</A>]) library which encapsulates
the operating system dependence and offers a uniform interface to the user.

<P>
We chose ACE over other libraries, since it runs on almost all relevant
platforms, including most Unix systems and Microsoft Windows,
and since it is to our knowledge the only library which is actively developed by a
large group. Furthermore,
it also is significantly larger than only thread management, offering
interprocess communication and communication between different computers, as
well as many other services. Contrary to most other libraries, it therefore
offers both the ability to support a growing <TT>deal.II</TT> as well as the
prospect to support independence also with respect to future platforms.
