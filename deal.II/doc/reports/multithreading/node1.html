Background</A>
</H1>

<P>
Realistic finite element simulations tend to use enormous amounts of computing
time and memory. Scientists and programmers have therefore long tried to use
the combined power of several processors or computers to tackle these
problems.

<P>
The usual approach is to use physically separated computers (e.g. clusters) or
computing units (e.g. processor nodes in a parallel computer), each of which
is equipped with its own memory, and split the problem at hand into separate
parts which are then solved on these computing units. Unfortunately, this
approach tends to pose significant problems, both for the mathematical
formulation as well as for the application programmer, which make the
development of such programs overly difficult and expensive.

<P>
For these reasons, parallelized implementations and their
mathematical background are still subject to intense research. In recent
years, however, multi-processor machines have been developed, which pose a
reasonable alternative to small parallel computers with the advantage of
simple programming and the possibility to use the same mathematical
formulation that can also be used for single-processor machines. These
computers typically have between two and eight processors that can access the
global memory at equal cost. 

<P>
Due to this uniform memory access (UMA) architecture, communication can be
performed in the global memory and is no more costly than access to any other
memory location. Thus, there is also no more need to change the mathematical
formulation to reduce communication, and programs using this architecture look
very much like programs written for single processor machines. 

<P>
The purpose of this report is to explain the techniques used in
<TT>deal.II</TT> (see [<A
 HREF="node13.html#BK99tr">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node13.html#BK99m">2</A>])
by which we try to program these computers. We will first
give a brief introduction in what threads are and what the problems are which
we have to solve when we want to use multi-threading. The third section takes an
in-depth look at the way in which the functionality of the operating system is
represented in a <TT>C++</TT> program in order to allow simple and robust
programming; in particular, we describe the design decisions which led us to
implement these parts of the library in the way they are implemented. In the
fourth section, we show several examples of parallelization and explain how
they work. Readers who are more interested in actually using the framework
laid out in this report, rather than the internals, may skip Section 3 and go
directly to the applications in Section <A HREF="node8.html#sec:applications">4</A> (page
<A HREF="node8.html#sec:applications"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
