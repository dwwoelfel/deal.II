<h1>Abstract</h1>

 In this paper, we present a super-convergence result for the Local
Discontinuous Galerkin method for a model elliptic problem on
Cartesian grids. We identify a <em>special</em> numerical flux for
which the <em>L<sup>2</sup></em>-norm of the gradient and the
<em>L<sup>2</sup></em>-norm of the potential are of order
<em>k+1/2</em> and <em>k+1</em>, respectively, when tensor product
polynomials of degree at most <em>k</em> are used; for arbitrary
meshes, this special LDG method gives only the orders of convergence
of <em>k</em> and <em>k+1/2</em>, respectively.  We present a series
of numerical examples which establish the sharpness of our theoretical
results.
