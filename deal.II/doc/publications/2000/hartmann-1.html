<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>

  We present an approach to solving conservation equations by the
  adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite element method
  (DG-method). Using a global duality argument and Galerkin
  orthogonality, we obtain a residual-based error representation for the
  error with respect to an arbitrary functional of the solution. This
  results in local indicators that can be evaluated numerically and
  which are used for adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. In this
  way, very economical and highly localized meshes can be generated
  which are tailored to the cost-efficient computation of the quantity
  of interest. We demonstrate the main ingredients of this approach of a
  posteriori error estimation, test the quality of the error estimator
  and the efficiency of the meshes by some numerical examples.
