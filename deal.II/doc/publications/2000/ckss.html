<h3>Abstract</h3>

<dir>
In this paper, we introduce and analyze local discontinuous Galerkin
methods for the Stokes system.  For arbitrary meshes with hanging
nodes and elements of various shapes we derive a priori estimates for
the <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>-norm of the errors in the velocities and
the pressure.  We show that <b>optimal</b> order estimates are
obtained when polynomials of degree <i>k</i> are used for each
component of the velocity and polynomials of degree <i>k</i>-1 for the
pressure, for any <i>k</i>&gt;1.  We also consider the case in which 
<b>all</b> the unknowns are approximated with polynomials of degree <i>k</i>
and show that, although the orders of convergence remain the same, the
method is more efficient. Numerical experiments verifying these facts
are displayed.
