<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
  In this report, we describe the implementational techniques of
  multi-threading support in deal.II, which we use for the
  parallelization of independent operations. Writing threaded programs in
  C++ is obstructed by two problems: operating system dependent
  interfaces and that these interfaces are created for C programs
  rather than for C++. We present our solutions to these problems and
  describe first experiences using multi-threading in deal.II.
