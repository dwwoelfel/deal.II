  <p>
  In this thesis, we develop adaptive finite element methods for
  parameter estimation problems involving partial differential
  equations as constraints. In these so-called <em>Inverse
  Problems</em>, the goal is the identification of a distributed
  coefficient in a PDE by measurements of the state variable. This has
  important applications where material parameters are to be
  recovered, but only indirect measurements are possible, such as
  identification of the underground structure from seismic
  measurements, or in nondestructive material testing.
  </p>

  <p>
  For this kind of problems, we develop adaptive finite element
  discretizations based on error estimates, where the estimates are
  both for the error in the minimization functional (i.e. of
  ``energy-type'') as well as in arbitrary functionals. Furthermore,
  methods are developed to handle constraints on the sought
  coefficients, based on active set strategies. The methods developed
  are numerically tested at a number of large scale inverse problems
  realizing some types of inverse problems that actually occur in
  applications.
