  In many applications the quantities of interest are a series of
  target functionals of the solution to the governing system of
  partial differential equations rather than the solution itself.  For
  example, in the field of aerodynamics, examples include the drag and
  lift coefficients of an airfoil immersed into a fluid, the pressure
  difference between the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil and
  point evaluations of the density or pressure on the profile of the
  airfoil. While traditionally these quantities are measured in wind
  tunnel experiments, nowadays these experiments are increasingly
  replaced by numerical simulations aiming to predict these quantities
  to a high level of accuracy.

  In a series of previous articles, we have developed the theory of
  goal--oriented <em>a posteriori</em> error estimation for
  discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to inviscid compressible
  fluid flows.  On the basis of Type I <em>a posteriori</em> bounds we
  considered the design of adaptive finite element algorithms that are
  capable of generating optimal meshes specifically tailored to the
  efficient computation of a <em>single</em> target functional of
  practical interest.  The purpose of the current article is to extend
  this earlier work to the case when <em>several</em> target
  functionals of the solution need to be simultaneously approximated
  to a given level of accuracy.
