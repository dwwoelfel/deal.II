<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
In this thesis we introduce a discontinuous Galerkin method for the
numerical solution of hyperbolic conversation laws, as for example the
compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Based on this finite
element method, we develop an adaptive algorithm for the efficient
computation of physically relevant quantities of the solution.  This
includes <em>a posteriori</em> error estimation of the error in the
computed quantity as well as adaptive mesh design specifically
tailored to the efficient computation of this quantity. We illustrate
this approach by several different hyperbolic problems in combination
with various different target quantities, including the efficient
computation of drag and lift coefficients of airfoils immersed in
inviscid compressible gas flows.
