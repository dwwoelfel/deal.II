<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
We present an approach to solving the acoustic wave equation by adaptive
  finite element methods. Using a global duality argument and Galerkin
  orthogonality, we obtain a residual-based error representation with respect to
 an
  arbitrary functional of the solution. This results in numerically
  evaluatable error estimates which are used for mesh refinement. In this way,
  very economical and highly localized space-time 
  meshes can be generated which are tailored to the efficient computation of
  the quantity of interest. We demonstrate the performance and some of the
  mechanisms acting in our approach by numerical examples.
