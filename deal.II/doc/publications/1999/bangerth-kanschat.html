<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>

An overview of the <TT>deal.II</TT>  library is given. This library provides
  the functionality  needed  by modern  numerical software  used in the finite
  element solution  of  partial  differential  equations,  offering adaptively
  refined meshes,  different  finite element   classes, multigrid solvers  and
  support for one, two and three spatial dimensions.

<P>
  
  We  give a  description of  the basic  design criteria  used  in the
  development of the library and how they were transformed into actual
  code,  and some  examples of  the use  of the  library  in numerical
  analysis.
