<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
In this paper a recently developed approach
  for the design of
  adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite element approximations
  is applied to physically relevant problems arising in inviscid compressible
  fluid flows governed by the
  Euler equations of gas dynamics.  In particular, we employ so--called
  weighted or Type I <em>a posteriori</em> error bounds to drive adaptive
  finite element algorithms for the estimation of
  the error measured in terms of general linear and nonlinear target
  functionals of the solution; typical examples considered here include
  the point evaluation of a component of the solution vector, and the
  drag and lift coefficients of a body immersed in an inviscid fluid.
  This general approach leads to the design of
  economical finite element meshes specifically tailored to the computation 
  of the target functional of interest, as well as providing reliable and
  efficient error estimation. Indeed, the superiority of the proposed
  approach over standard mesh refinement algorithms which employ <em>
    ad hoc</em> error indicators will be illustrated by a series of 
  numerical experiments; here, we consider
  transonic flow through a nozzle, as well as subsonic, transonic and
  supersonic flows around different airfoil geometries.
