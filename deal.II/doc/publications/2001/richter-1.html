<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
In this thesis, the <em>dual weighted residual</em> a posteriori error
estimator is studied for error estimation in arbitrary (linear)
functionals. The main focus is the construction of optimal meshes for
the solution of elliptic differential equations.
The quality of the meshes is measured by the effort to gain a suitable
solution of the differential equation and by the effort to generate
the mesh.
The <em>dual weighted error estimator</em> is used for <em>hierarchical
mesh refinemant</em>. One chapter discusses the application of the
error estimator for optimal anisotropic meshes.
