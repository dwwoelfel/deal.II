<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
    In this work, adaptive concepts  for the numerical   solution of the  wave
    equation   in inhomogeneous media  are derived  and  applied to an example
    taken from the physics of the solar atmosphere. The main  focus is on ways
    to estimate  the error in the numerical  solution with regard to arbitrary
    functionals,  i.e. quantities of interest, and the use of these estimates
    for the generation of computational meshes  best suited for the evaluation
    of this functional.

<p>
    
    Advantages and difficulties of this method are presented. In particular,
    it is shown  that the  proposed approach is  significantly better  in many
    cases than previous adaptive schemes not  taking into account the quantity
    of interest.    Cases involving nonlinear   functionals and  in which  the
    approach fails,  are  presented  along with theoretical   explanations and
    numerical evidence of the reasons for this.

<p>
    
    The proposed methods are applied to a simple model from the physics of the
    solar atmosphere and the propagation of linear acoustic waves is computed.
    The fraction of  the  wave  energy  that passes  the  chromosphere-corona
    transition is computed to good accuracy.
