<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tutorial contains a collection of
programs, each more
or less built atop of previous ones, which demonstrate various
aspects of the library. Each such example has the following structure
follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Introduction:</b> A brief description of what the program does and
       what is new compared to the previous programs. This also includes a
       discussion of the mathematical model and its formulation.
  <li> <b>The commented program:</b> A listing of the program, interspersed
       with many comments that explain what is going on, how things are done
       and why.
  <li> <b>Results:</b> The output of the program, with some comments and
       interpretation.
  <li> <b>The plain program:</b> Since the program itself usually is a little
       bit unreadable with all the comments intertwined, we present the
       program again, with all comments stripped off, to allow getting an
       overview of it.
</ol>

<p>
You can browse through the list of currently available tutorial programs in
three different ways:
<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="toc-map.html">form of a graph</a> that shows how
  tutorial programs build upon each other.

  <li>In the <a href="toc-list.html">form of a list</a> that provides a short
  synopsis of what each program does and which new concepts it introduces.

  <li>In the <a href="toc-topics.html">form of groups of topics</a> such as
  solvers or the kind of equations that different sets of tutorial program
  address. 
</ul>
Some of the programs also jointly form
the <a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/group__geodynamics.html">geodynamics
  demonstration suite</a>.
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
The programs are in the <code>examples/</code> directory of your local deal.II
installation. If you go into one of the tutorial directories, you can compile
the program by typing <strong>make</strong>, and run it
using <strong>make run</strong>. The latter command also compiles the program
if that has not already been done. The Makefiles in the different
directories are based on the small program Makefile template described
<a href="../../development/index.html" target="_top">in this section</a>.
