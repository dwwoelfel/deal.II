<h1>Step-by-Step Examples</h1>

<p>
This tutorial contains a collection of small programs, each more
or less built atop of the previous ones, which demonstrate various
aspects of the library. The general layout of each such example is as
follows:
<ol>
  <li> A brief description of what the program does and what is new
       compared to the previous programs.
  <li> The program, in commented form.
  <li> The output of the program, with some comments.
  <li> Since the program itself usually is a little bit unreadable
       with all the comments intertwingled, we present the program again,
       with all comments stripped off, to allow getting an overview of it.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The programs themselves can be found at a path which is indicated at
the beginning of the last section of each example. You can compile
them by typing <strong>make</strong> in the respective directory, and run them
using <strong>make run</strong>. The latter command also compiles the program if
that has not already been done. The Makefiles in the different
directories are based on the small program Makefile template described
in <a href="../../development/index.html" target="_top">in this section</a>.
</p>


<p>
At present, the following programs exist:
</p>

<dl>
      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_1.html">Step 1</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Everything. We create a grid
      and show a simple way to write it to a file.
      </dd>
    
      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_2.html">Step 2</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Associate degrees of freedom to
      each vertex and compute the resulting sparsity pattern of
      matrices. Show that renumbering reduces the bandwidth of
      matrices significantly, i.e. clusters nonzero entries around the
      diagonal.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_3.html">Step 3</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> Actually solve Laplace's
      problem. Object-orientation. Assembling matrices and
      vectors. Boundary values.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_4.html">Step 4</a></dt> 
      <dd><strong>What's new:</strong> This example is programmed in a
      way that it is independent of the dimension for which we want to
      solve Laplace's equation; we will solve the equation in 2D and
      3D, although the program is exactly the same. Non-constant right
      hand side function. Non-homogeneous boundary values.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_5.html">Step 5</a></dt>

      refined grids. Reading a grid from disk. Some optimizations.  
      Using assertions. Non-constant coefficient in
      the elliptic operator. Preconditioning the CG solver for the
      linear system of equations.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/step_6.html">Step 6</a></dt>

      refinement. Handling of hanging nodes. Higher order elements.
      Catching exceptions in the &#8220;main&#8221; function.

      solved instead of Laplace's equation. The solution is
      vector-valued and the equations form a system with as many
      equations as the dimension of the space in which it is posed.
