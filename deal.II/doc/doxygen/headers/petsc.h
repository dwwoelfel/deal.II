/**
 * @defgroup PETScWrappers PETScWrappers
 * 
 * The classes in this module are
 * wrappers around functionality provided by the PETSc library. They provide a
 * modern object-oriented interface that is compatible with the interfaces of
 * the other linear algebra classes in deal.II. All classes and functions in
 * this group reside in a namespace @p PETScWrappers.
 *
 * These classes are only available if a PETSc installation was detected
 * during configuration of deal.II. Refer to the README file for more details
 * about this.
