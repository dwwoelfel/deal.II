Move the exceptions in the Tensor package (tensor_base.h and tensor.h)
  back into the Tensor class, if the compiler allows to do so. Also
  rename them back (i.e. drop the initial Tensor* from the name).



Think about the determinant function in the tensor package. Is it
  useful, can it be generalized?


Put Tensor<1,dim>::array_size directly into the array type. At
  present, egcs 1.1.2 chokes on that.
