Move the exceptions in the Tensor package (tensor_base.h and tensor.h)
  back into the Tensor class, if the compiler allows to do so. Also
  rename them back (i.e. drop the initial Tensor* from the name).



Think about the determinant function in the tensor package. Is it
  useful, can it be generalized?

Put Tensor<1,dim>::array_size directly into the array type. At
  present, egcs 1.1.2 chokes on that.


Fill in docs for the timer class. Hopefully finally find a way to
  let it measure times larger than half an hour.

Revert istrstream(p.c_str()) to istrstream(p) when possible
  (parameter_handler.cc)


QGauss8 seems not to be correct. It evaluates integrals only up to
appr. 1e-11 and not as the other quadratures up to 2e-16.


Change <iostream> to <ostream> in grid/point.h and
  grid/tria_iterator.h when this becomes possible.


Add support for void member functions also for Mem_Fun_Data[5-*] and
  Mem_Fun*.
