/**
 * This class offers triangulations of some standard domains such as hypercubes,
 * hyperball and the like. Following is a list of domains that can be generated
 * by the functions of this class:
 * <ul>
 *    <li> Generalized L-shape domain:
 *      using the GridGenerator::hyper_L (tria, a,b) function produces
 *      the hypercube with the interval $[a,b]$ without the hypercube
 *      made out of the interval $[(a+b)/2,b]$. Let, for example, be $a=-1$
 *      and $b=1$, then the hpyer-L in two dimensions is the region
 *      $[-1,1]^2 - [0,1]^2$. To create a hyper-L in one dimension results in
 *      an error. The function is also implemented for three space dimensions.
 *
 *    <li> Hyper ball:
 *      You get the circle or ball (or generalized: hyperball) around
 *      origin @p p and with radius @p r by calling
 *      GridGenerator::hyper_ball (tria, p, r). The circle is
 *      triangulated by five cells, the ball by seven cells. The
 *      diameter of the center cell is chosen so that the aspect ratio
 *      of the boundary cells after one refinement is minimized in
 *      some way. To create a hyperball in one dimension results in an
 *      error.
 *
 *      Do not forget to also attach a suitable boundary approximation object
 *      to the triangulation object you passed to this function if you later want
 *      the triangulation to be refined at the outer boundaries.
 *
 *    <li> Half Hyper ball:
 *      You get half of the circle generated by Hyper ball.
 *      with center @p p and with radius @p r by calling
 *      GridGenerator::half_hyper_ball (tria, p, r). The half-circle is 
 *      triangulated by four cells. The diameter of the center cell is
 *      chosen to be the same as for the Hyper ball class. 
 *      To create a half-hyperball in one dimension results in
 *      an error.
 *
 *      Do not forget to also attach a suitable boundary approximation object
 *      to the triangulation object you passed to this function if you later want
 *      the triangulation to be refined at the outer boundaries. The class
 *      HalfHyperBallBoundary will provide a boundary object.
 *
 *    <li> Hyper shell: A hyper shell is the region between two hyper
 *      sphere with the same origin. Therefore, it is a ring in two
 *      spatial dimensions. To triangulation it, call the function
 *      GridGenerator::hyper_shell (tria, origin, inner_radius, outer_radius, N),
 *      where the center of the spheres as well as
 *      the inner and outer radius of the two spheres are given as
 *      shown.
 *
 *      The parameter @p N denotes how many cells are to be used for
 *      this coarse triangulation. It defaults to zero, which tells
 *      the function to chose the number itself; this, then, is done
 *      such that the aspect ration of the resulting cells is as small
 *      as possible. However, it should be mentioned that this
 *      function does not work very well if the inner radius is much
 *      smaller than the outer radius since only one layer of cells is
 *      used in the radial direction.
 *
 *      You need to attach a boundary object to the triangulation. A
 *      suitable boundary class is provided as HyperSphereBoundary
 *      in the library.
 *
 *    <li> Half shells: This is a variant of the preceding domain,
 *      where only one half of the shell is taken, defined by the first
 *      coordinate having non-negative values. This class is useful in
 *      computations with rotational symmetry, as then a 3d shell can be
 *      modeled by a 2d half shell.
 *
 *    <li> Slit domain: The slit domain is a variant of the hyper cube
 *      domain. In two spatial dimensions, it is a square into which a slit
 *      is sawed; if the initial square is though to be composed of four
 *      smaller squares, then two of them are not connected even though
 *      they are neighboring each other. Analogously, into the cube in
 *      three spatial dimensions, a half-plane is sawed, disconnecting four
 *      of the eight child-cubes from one of their neighbors.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Some of these functions receive a flag @p colorize. If this is
 * set, parts of the boundary receive different boundary numbers,
 * allowing them to be distinguished by application programs. See the
 * documentation of the functions for details.
 * 
 * Additionally this class provides a function
 * (@p laplace_transformation) that smoothly transforms a grid
 * according to given new boundary points. This can be used to
 * transform (simple-shaped) grids to a more complicated ones, like a
 * shell onto a grid of an airfoil, for example.
