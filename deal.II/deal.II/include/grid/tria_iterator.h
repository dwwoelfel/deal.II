/**
 *   This class implements an iterator, analogous to those of the standard
 *   template library (STL). It fulfills the requirements of a bidirectional iterator.
 *   See the C++ documentation for further details of iterator specification and
 *   usage. In addition to the STL
 *   iterators an iterator of this class provides a @p{->} operator, i.e. you can
 *   write statements like @p{i->set_refine_flag ();}.
 *   
 *   @em{Note:} Please read the documentation about the prefix and the
 *   postfix @p{++} operators in this and the derived classes!
 *   
 *   @sect3{Purpose}
 *
 *   @p{iterators} are used whenever a loop over all lines, quads, cells etc.
 *   is to be performed. These loops can then be coded like this:
 *   @begin{verbatim}
 *     cell_iterator i   = tria.begin();
 *     cell_iterator end = tria.end();
 *     for (; i!=end; ++i)
 *       if (cell->at_boundary())
 *         cell->set_refine_flag();
 *   @end{verbatim}
 *   Note the usage of @p{++i} instead of @p{i++} since this does not involve
 *   temporaries and copying. You should also really use a fixed value
 *   @p{end} rather than coding @p{for (; i!=tria.end(); ++i)}, since
 *   the creation and copying of these iterators is rather expensive
 *   compared to normal pointers.
 *   
 *   The objects pointed to by iterators are @ref{TriangulationLevel<1>}@p{::LinesData},
 *   @ref{TriangulationLevel<2>}@p{::LinesData}
 *   and @ref{TriangulationLevel<2>}@p{::QuadsData}. To chose which of those, the
 *   template parameter @p{Pointee} is used.
 *
 *   Since the names as is are quite unhandy, the @ref{Triangulation} class which
 *   uses these iterators declares typedef'd versions. See there for more
 *   information.
 *
 *   The objects pointed to are, as mentioned, @ref{LinesData} etc. To be
 *   more exact, when dereferencing an iterator, you do not get a @ref{LineData}
 *   object (or the like, but we will assume that you have a @p{line_iterator}
 *   in the following), but a @em{virtual} object (called @em{accessor}) which
 *   behaves as if it stored the data of a line. It does not contain any data
 *   itself, but provides functions to manipulate the data of the line it
 *   stands for.
 *
 *   Since the data of one line is splitted to
 *   several arrays (@p{lines}, @p{children} and @p{used}) for performance reasons
 *   rather than keeping all information in a @ref{Line} struct, access through
 *   an accessor is usually much simpler than handling the exact data structure
 *   and also less error prone since the data structure itself can be changed
 *   in an arbitrary way while the only pieces of code which access these
 *   data structures are the accessors.
 *
 *   On the other hand, iterators are not much slower than operating directly
 *   on the data structures, since they perform the loops that you had
 *   to handcode yourself anyway. Most iterator and accessor functions are
 *   inlined. 
 *
 *   The main functionality of iterators, however, resides in the @p{++} and
 *   @p{--} operators. These move the iterator forward or backward just as if
 *   it were a pointer into an array. Here, this operation is not so easy,
 *   since it may include skipping some elements and the transition between
 *   the triangulation levels. This is completely hidden from the user, though
 *   you can still create an iterator pointing to an arbitrary element.
 *   Actually, the operation of moving iterators back and forth is not done in
 *   the iterator classes, but rather in the accessor classes. Since these are
 *   passed as template arguments, you can write your own versions here to add
 *   more functionality.
 *
 *   Furthermore, the iterators decribed here satisfy the requirement of
 *   input and bidirectional iterators as stated by the C++ standard and
 *   the STL documentation. It is therefore possible to use the functions
 *   from the @em{algorithm section} of the C++ standard, e.g. @p{count_if}
 *   (see the documentation for @ref{Triangulation} for an example) and
 *   several others.
 *   
 *
 *   @sect3{Differences between the classes in this inheritance tree}
 *
 *   @p{TriaRawIterator} objects point to lines, cells, etc in
 *   the lists whether they are used or not (in the vectors, also @em{dead}
 *   objects are stored, since deletion in vectors is expensive and we
 *   also do not want to destroy the ordering induced by the numbering
 *   in the vectors). Therefore not all raw iterators point to valid objects.
 *   
 *   There are two derived versions of this class: @ref{TriaIterator}
 *   objects, which only loop over used (valid) cells and
 *   @p{TriaActiveIterator} objects
 *   which only loop over active cells (not refined).
 *
 *   
 *   @sect3{Implementation}
 *
 *   In principle, the Iterator class does not have much functionality. It
 *   only becomes useful when assigned an @p{Accessor} (the second template
 *   parameter), which really does the access to data. An @p{Accessor} has to
 *   fulfil some requirements:
 *   @begin{itemize}
 *     @item It must have two members named @p{present_level} and @p{present_index}
 *       storing the address of the element in the triangulation presently
 *       pointed to. Furthermore, the three @p{Tria{Raw| |Active}Iterator} classes
 *       have to be friends to the accessor or these data members must be public.
 *     @item It must have a constructor which takes 1. a @p{Triangulation<dim>*},
 *       2. and 3. and integer, denoting the initial level and index.
 *     @item For the @p{TriaIterator} and the @p{TriaActiveIterator} class, it must
 *       have a member function @p{bool used()}, for the latter a member function
 *       @p{bool active()}.
 *     @item It must have void operators @p{++} and @p{--}.
 *     @item It must declare a local @p{typedef} @p{AccessorData} which states
 *       the data type the accessor expects to get passed as fourth constructor
 *       argument. By declaring a local data type, the respective iterator
 *       class may type-safely enforce that data type to be one of its own
 *       constructor argument types. If an accessor class does not need
 *       additional data, this type shall be @p{void}.
 *   @end{itemize}
 *   Then the iterator is able to do what it is supposed to. All of the necessary
 *   functions are implemented in the @p{Accessor} base class, but you may write
 *   your own version (non-virtual, since we use templates) to add functionality.
 *
 *   There is a standard implementation, using classes which are derived from
 *   @ref{TriaAccessor}. These classes point to @ref{Line}s, @ref{Quad}s and the like.
 *   For advanced use of the iterator classes, derive classes from
 *   @p{{Line|Quad|Cell}Accessor} which also dereference data structures in other
 *   objects, e.g. in a finite element context. An iterator with such an accessor
 *   then simultaneously points to (for example) a cell in the triangulation and
 *   the data stored on it in the finite element class.
 *
 *   Derived accessor classes may need additional data (e.g. the @ref{DoFAccessor}
 *   needs a pointer to the @ref{DoFHandler} to work on). This data can be
 *   set upon construction through the last argument of the constructors.
 *   The data type of this additional data is given by the local data type
 *   @ref{AccessorData} explained above. The iterator classes take a pointer to
 *   an object of that data type; by default, this parameter equals the
 *   @p{NULL} pointer.
 *   
 *   
 *   @sect3{Warning}
 *
 *   It seems impossible to preserve @p{const}ness of a triangulation through
 *   iterator usage. Thus, if you declare pointers to a @p{const} triangulation
 *   object, you should be well aware that you might involuntarily alter the
 *   data stored in the triangulation.
 *
 *
 *   @sect3{Internals}
 *   
 *   There is a representation of past-the-end-pointers, denoted by special
 *   values of the member variables @p{present_level} and @p{present_index}:
 *   If @p{present_level>=0} and @p{present_index>=0}, then the object is valid
 *   (there is no check whether the triangulation really has that
 *   many levels or that many cells on the present level when we investigate
 *   the state of an iterator; however, in many places where an iterator is
 *   dereferenced we make this check);
 *   if @p{present_level==-1} and @p{present_index==-1}, then the iterator points
 *   past the end; in all other cases, the iterator is considered invalid.
 *   You can check this by calling the @p{state()} function.
 *
 *   An iterator is also invalid, if the pointer pointing to the @ref{Triangulation}
 *   object is invalid or zero.
 *
 *   Finally, an iterator is invalid, if the element pointed to by
 *   @p{present_level} and @p{present_index} is not used, i.e. if the @p{used}
 *   flag is set to false.
 *
 *   The last two checks are not made in @p{state()} since both cases should only
 *   occur upon unitialized construction through @p{memcpy} and the like (the
 *   parent triangulation can only be set upon construction). If
 *   an iterator is constructed empty through the empty constructor,
 *   @p{present_level==-2} and @p{present_index==-2}. Thus, the iterator is
 *   invalid anyway, regardless of the state of the triangulation pointer
 *   and the state of the element pointed to.
 *
 *   Past-the-end iterators may also be used to compare an iterator with the
 *   @em{before-the-start} value, when running backwards. There is no
 *   distiction between the iterators pointing past the two ends of a vector.
 *   
 *   By defining only one value to be past-the-end and making all other values
 *   invalid porvides a second track of security: if we should have forgotten
 *   a check in the library when an iterator is incremented or decremented,
 *   we automatically convert the iterator from the allowed state "past-the-end"
 *   to the disallowed state "invalid" which increases the chance that somehwen
 *   earlier than for past-the-end iterators an exception is raised.
