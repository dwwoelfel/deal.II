/**
 * Common interface of all finite elements. Here, the functions to
 * fill the data fields of FEValues are declared.
 *
 * The interface of this class is very restrictive. The reason is that
 * finite element values should be accessed only by use of
 * FEValues objects. These, together with @p FiniteElement are
 * responsible to provide an optimized implementation.
 *
 * This even holds for evaluating finite elements at their support
 * points (provided the element is based on Lagrangian interpolation):
 * first, it is necessary to construct a quadrature rule from the
 * support points. This is then fed into an object of class
 * FEValues. Even for evaluation on the unit cell, you will need
 * a triangulation containing that single cell.
 *
 * Basically, this class just declares the shape function and their
 * derivatives on the unit cell $[0,1]^d$, and the means to transform
 * them onto a given cell in physical space if provided by the
 * FEValues class with a Mapping object.
