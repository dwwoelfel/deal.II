/**
 * Implementation of Raviart-Thomas (RT) elements, conforming with the
 * space H<sup>div</sup>. These elements generate vector fields with
 * normel components continuous between mesh cells.
 *
 * @todo Right now, the description of node values and interpolation
 * does not match the actual state of this class. This will be
 * improved after some discussion.
 *
 * We follow the usual definition of the degree of RT elements, which
 * denotes the polynomial degree of the largest complete polynomial
 * subspace contained in the RT space. Then, approciamtion order of
 * the function itself is <i>degree+1</i>, as with usual polynomial
 * spaces.
 *
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on
 * consistently oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken
 * on complicated meshes.
 *
 * <h3>Interpolation</h3>
 *
 * The @ref GlossInterpolation "interpolation" operators associated
 * with the RT element are constructed such that interpolation and
 * computing the divergence are commuting operations. We require this
 * from interpolating arbitrary functions as well as the #restriction
 * matrices.  It can be achieved by two interpolation schemes, the
 * simplified one in FE_RaviartThomasNodal and the original one here:
 *
 * <h4>Node values on edges/faces</h4>
 *
 * On edges or faces, the @GlossNodes "node values" are the moments of
 * the normal component of the interpolated function with respect to
 * the traces of the RT polynomials. Since the normal trace of the RT
 * space of degree <i>k</i> on an edge/face is the space
 * <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i>, the moments are taken with respect to this
 * space.
 *
 * <h4>Interior node values</h4>
 *
 * Higher order RT spaces have interior nodes. These are moments taken
 * with respect to the gradient of functions in <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i>
 * on the cell (this space is the matching space for RT<sub>k</sub> in
 * a mixed formulation).
 *
 * <h4>Generalized support points</h4>
 *
 * The node values above rely on integrals, which will be computed by
 * quadrature rules themselves. The generalized support points are a
 * set of points such that this quadrature can be performed with
 * sufficient accuracy. The points needed are thode of
 * QGauss<sub>k+1</k> on each face as well as QGauss<sub>k</k> in
 * the interior of the cell (or none for RT<sub>0</sub>).
 *
 * @internal
 * <h3>Numbering of the degrees of freedom (DoFs)</h3>
 *
 * This paragraph is obsolete and will be removed after reconstruction
 * of the element is complete.
 *
 * Raviart-Thomas elements have their degrees of freedom on edges,
 * with shape functions being vector valued and pointing in normal
 * direction. We use the standard enumeration and direction of edges
 * in deal.II, yielding the following shape functions in 2d:
 *
 *   @verbatim
 *          2
 *      *---^---*
 *      |       |
 *     3>       >1
 *      |       |
 *      *---^---*
 *          0
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * For the 3d case, the ordering follows the same scheme: the lines
 * are numbered as described in the documentation of the
 * Triangulation class, i.e.
 *   @verbatim
 *         *---6---*        *---6---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *      11 |       5      11     10 5
 *      /  7       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *---2---*   |
 *     |   *---4---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       1  /
 *     3 8       9      3       | 9
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *---0---*        *---0---*
 *   @endverbatim
 * and their directions are as follows:
 *   @verbatim
 *         *--->---*        *--->---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       ^ |       ^      ^       ^ ^
 *      /  ^       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *--->---*   |
 *     |   *--->---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       ^  /
 *     ^ ^       ^      ^       | ^
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *--->---*        *--->---*
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * The element does not make much sense in 1d, so it is not
 * implemented there.

/**
 * The Raviart-Thomas elements with node functionals defined as point
 * values in Gauss points.
 *
 * <h3>Description of node values</h3>
 *
 * For this Raviart-Thomas element, the node values are not cell and
 * face moments with respect to certain polynomials, but the values in
 * quadrature points. Following the general scheme for numbering
 * degrees of freedom, the node values on edges are first, edge by
 * edge, according to the natural ordering of the edges of a cell. The
 * interior degrees of freedom are last.
 *
 * For an RT-element of degree <i>k</i>, we choose
 * <i>(k+1)<sup>d-1</sup></i> Gauss points on each face. These points
 * are ordered lexicographically with respect to the orientation of
 * the face. This way, the normal component which is in
 * <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> is uniquely determined. Furthermore, since
 * this Gauss-formula is exact on <i>Q<sub>2k+1</sub></i>, these node
 * values correspond to the exact integration of the moments of the
 * RT-space.
 *
 * In the interior of the cells, the moments are with respect to an
 * anisotropic <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> space, where the test functions
 * are one degree lower in the direction corresponding to the vector
 * component under consideration. This is emulated by using an
 * anisotropic Gauss formula for integration.
 *
 * @todo The current implementation is for Cartesian meshes
 * only. You must use MappingCartesian.
 * 
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on
 * consistently oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken
 * on complicated meshes.
 *
 * @note The degree stored in the member variable
 * FiniteElementData<dim>::degree is higher by one than the
 * constructor argument!
