 * @sect3{Information for all hpDoFLevel() classes}
 *
 * The hpDoFLevel()<tt><N></tt> classes 
 * store the global indices of the degrees of freedom for each cell on a
 * certain level. The index or number of a degree of freedom is the zero-based
 * index of the according value in the solution vector and the row and column
 * index in the global matrix or the multigrid matrix for this level. These
 * indices refer to the unconstrained vectors and matrices, where we have not
 * taken account of the constraints introduced by hanging nodes. If more than
 * one value corresponds to one basis function, for example for vector equations
 * where the solution is vector valued and thus has several degrees of freedom
 * for each basis function, we nonetheless store only one index. This can then
 * be viewed as the index into a block vector, where each block contains the
 * different values according to a degree of freedom. It is left to the derived
 * classes, whether the values in a block are stored consecutively or distributed
 * (e.g. if the solution function is $u=(u_1, u_2)$, we could store the values
 * in the solution vector like
 * $\ldots, u_1^m, u_2^m, u_1^{m+1}, u_2^{m+1},\ldots$ with $m$ denoting the
 * $m$th basis function, or $\ldots, u_1^m, u_1^{m+1}, u_1^{m+2}, \ldots,
 * u_2^m, u_2^{m+1}, u_2^{m+2}, \ldots$, respectively). Likewise, the
 * constraint matrix returned by DoFHandler<tt>::make_hanging_node_constraints ()</tt>
 * is then
 * to be understood as a block matrix.
 *
 * The storage format of the degrees of freedom indices (short: DoF
 * indices) is somewhat like a mirror of the data structures of the
 * triangulation classes.  There is a hierarchy of
 * hpDoFLevel()<tt><dim></tt> classes for the different dimensions which
 * have objects named @p line_dofs, @p quad_dofs and so on, in which
 * the indices of DoFs located on lines and quads, respectively, are
 * stored. The indices are stored levelwise. 
 *
 * Due to the fact that different elements could have a different number
 * of DoFs on each line, the DoFs on each line are stored in a nested data
 * structure. @p dof_line_index_offset is used to find the start of the
 * DoFs indices inside @p line_dofs. Hence the retrieval of DoF indices
 * for a specific line @p i is a two step process:
 * 1. Determine the index @p j in @p line_dofs, as the @p ith element of
 *    @p dof_line_index_offset
 * 2. Get the DoF indices starting from the @p jth element in @p line_dofs.
 *
 * The DoF indices for vertices are not stored this way, since they
 * need different treatment in multigrid environments. If no multigrid
 * is used, the indices are stored in the @p vertex_dofs array of the
 * DoFHandler class.
