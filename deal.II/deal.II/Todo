Remove the comment signs in the monitor_* functions in tria.cc
  as early as possible. These were inserted, since at home the
  program did some strange things in the reserve_memory
  functions (allocated more memory than told), such that the
  memory checks failed.


Rewrite code like
      int flagged_cells = 0;
      for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
	if (cell->refine_flag_set())
	  ++flagged_cells;
  using the STL count() operation with a member function predicate if
  available.


Write monitors to control whether enough memory was allocated for
  the vectors (i.e. after a process, whether size()==capacity()).
  (for DoF)


Write Triangulation::mesh_function.


Unify CellAccessor<1> and <2> by renaming
    LineAccessor<dim> -> SubstructAccessor<dim,1>
    QuadAccessor<dim> -> SubstructAccessor<dim,2>
  and deriving CellAccessor<dim> from SubstructAccessor<dim,dim>
  Do the same with DoFLineAccessor and DoFQuadAccessor


Make AssemblerData a local class to Assembler again if gcc2.8 supports it.


Let ParameterHandler and DataIn/Out throw exceptions. Make more tests
  on the input. Same for output: check whether file could be created etc.
  

Remove gcc2.8 workaround with DoFSubstructAccessor


Check usage of vector<>s: functions should assume that the objects have
  the right size already.


Update DataIO for ucd i/o of boundary flags and material values:
  is it correct if for the number of elements I give the number
  of cells + number of faces with boundary id .neq. 0 ? Or must
  I give the number of cells?


Update DoFHandler::distribute_cell_to_dof_vector for higher order
  elements (it can presently only handle elements with the only dofs
  on the vertices).


Remove FiniteElementData<>::operator == and let it be generated
  implicitely.


Look at the fill_fe_values functions for possible optimizations
  since this is one of the most often called functions.


Try to find out what happens if DoFAccessor::get_dof_values is
  called for a non-active object: what about dof numbers
  on non-active lines/quads? Are they all zero? Can we check for
  that.


Change <iostream> to <ostream> in grid/point.h and
  grid/tria_iterator.h when this becomes possible.


Fix all those workarounds in Tria::refine_fixed_fraction


Fill in docs for the timer class.


Use a correct strategy to output the reduction rate for adaptively
  refined grids in examples/error-estimation


In VectorTools::project_boundary_values, no condensation of sparsity
  structures, matrices and right hand sides or distribution of
  solution vectors is performed, This is ok for dim<3 because then
  there are no constrained nodes on the boundary, but is not
  acceptable for higher dimensions. Fix this.


Remove the this-> coding in tria_iterator.templates.h. These were
  introduced in order to avoid an internal compiler error in an
  egcs  snapshot.


Re-enable printing of a preamble to ucd files in data_io.cc.


Implement coarsening of grids and update docs for that. Note the
  difference between refinement and coarsening: refinement
  deliberately adds additional refinment flags to keep consistency
  and thus refining all cells which were flagged for refinement.
  Coarsening on the contrary never deletes additional cells.
  Update algo section in tria docs for new smoothing strategies.

  What happens if cells on the coarest level are flagged??



Check all places where condensation of matrices/vectors and
  application of boundary values takes place. I am not sure about
  the right order in which they have to be applied, but in 2D there
  is no difference since constrained dofs cannot be on the boundary.
  Problems with the order will therefore not show up in 2D but may
  become apparent in 3D, so keep this in mind for the implementation
  of the 3D library.


Delete exception Triangulation<>::ExcUnusedMemoryAtEnd




DEAL:
Is dvector::operator= (double) really useful or does it make more
  confusion than it helps?


Give mia::State a much better name, same for Control ! :-]]]


Let all the reinit functions in /lac free their memory, if reinit
  is called with less requirements. Maybe give free all memory
  if the given dimension is zero. If so, check all deal.II files
  for use of reinit. (At present, new dimension==0 is not allowed.)
  [Done for dFMatrix and dVector; still to be done for the other
  classes.]

Why are there all these unsafe casts from VectorBase to dVector
  in dvector.cc?

Use unsigned integers for the colnums array in dSMatrixStruct. This
  would enhance safety since colnum=-1 would no longer point to a
  valid address.

Let dSMatrixStruct::compress free the memory of colnums which is
  no longer needed.
