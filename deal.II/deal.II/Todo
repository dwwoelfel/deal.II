Remove the comment signs in the monitor_* functions in tria.cc
  as early as possible. These were inserted, since at home the
  program did some strange things in the reserve_memory
  functions (allocated more memory than told), such that the
  memory checks failed.


Rewrite code like
      int flagged_cells = 0;
      for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
	if (cell->refine_flag_set())
	  ++flagged_cells;
  using the STL count() operation with a member function predicate if
  available.


Write monitors to control whether enough memory was allocated for
  the vectors (i.e. after a process, whether size()==capacity()).
  (for DoF)

Write Triangulation::mesh_function.


Unify CellAccessor<1> and <2> by renaming
    LineAccessor<dim> -> SubstructAccessor<dim,1>
    QuadAccessor<dim> -> SubstructAccessor<dim,2>
  and deriving CellAccessor<dim> from SubstructAccessor<dim,dim>
  Do the same with DoFLineAccessor and DoFQuadAccessor

Unify FEValues<dim> and FEFaceValues<dim> to FEValues<dim,subdim>
  and use partial specialization.


Add support for fast assemblage of mass matrices.

Make AssemblerData a local class to Assembler again if gcc2.8 supports it.

Let ParameterHandler and DataIn/Out throw exceptions. Make more tests
  on the input.
  
Replace function objects by mem_fun, fun_ptr, ... when member function
  templates are supported.


Remove gcc2.8 workaround with DoFSubstructAccessor


Use the C++ standard string classes instead of the libg++ String
  class.


Check usage of vectors: functions should assume that the objects have
  the right size already.


Update DataIO for ucd i/o of boundary flags and material values:
  is it correct if for the number of elements I give the number
  of cells + number of faces with boundary id .neq. 0 ? Or must
  I give the number of cells?


Update DoFHandler::distribute_cell_to_dof_vector for higher order
  elements (it can presently only handle elements with the only dofs
  on the vertices).


Remove FiniteElementData<>::operator == and let it be generated
  implicitely.

Look at the fill_fe_values functions for possible optimizations.


Try to find out what happens if DoFAccessor::get_dof_values is
  called for a non-active object: what about dof numbers
  on non-active lines/quads? Are they all zero? Can we check for
  that.




DEAL:
Let an empty dfmatrix assume it has dimensions zero rather than one!

Is dvector::operator= (double) really useful or does it make more
  confusion than it helps?


Give mia::State a much better name, same for Control ! :-]]]


Let all the reinit functions in /lac free their memory, if reinit
  is called with less requirements. Maybe give free all memory
  if the given dimension is zero. If so, check all deal.II files
  for use of reinit.

Why are there all these unsafe casts from VectorBase to dVector
  in dvector.cc?

Use unsigned integers for the colnums array in dSMatrixStruct. This
  would enhance safety since colnum=-1 would no longer point to a
  valid address. Additionally, add a break statement upon first
  encounter of sorted colnums==-1 in dsmatrixstruct::compress (by
  now, all -1's are sorted _first_, so we can't skip them if we want
  to get to the other colnums. If it were MAXINT instead of -1, we
  could skip all entries after finding the first MAXINT).

Optimize dSMatrixStruct::compress, using standard sort algorithms
  and only sorting the used range of indices, not those with
  -1 entries.
