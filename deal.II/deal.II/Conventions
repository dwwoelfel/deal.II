Here are some conventions for source code of the deal.II library:
=================================================================

1./ Functions which return the number of something (number of cells,
  degrees of freedom, etc) should start with n_*

2./ Function which set a bit or flag should start with set_* (an
  unfortunate relict is the flag_refine function); functions which
  clear bits of flags should be named clear_*

3./ After each function, at least three empty lines are expected to
  enable better readability. One empty line occurs in functions to
  group blocks of code, two empty lines are not enough to distinguish
  visibly enough.

4./ Whenever an integer variable can only assume nonnegative values,
  it has to be marked as unsigned int.

5./ Whenever an argument will not be changed, it should be marked
  const, even if it passed by value. This makes programs more readable
  and lets the compiler issue warnings if such a parameter variable is
  changed, which is often either involuntarily or poor style.

6./ Whenever a function does not change any of the member variable of
  the embedding class/object, it should be marked as const.

7./ Each class has to have at least 200 pages of documentation ;-)
