// Note: you should not usually have to change this file, as it is
// automatically generated from the ./configure file in the top level
// directory. If there are problems with the contents of this file,
// rather than changing it, try to modify the mechanisms in
// configure.in that generated this output. The reason is that you
// would have to make these changes each time you compile a new
// version of the library, or on a different computer. Furthermore, it
// is important not to build different parts of the library with
// different versions of this file.
//
// In case of problems in autodetection of features of your build
// environment, contact the authors of the library.
