Make ILU decomposition faster by following the comment in the
  innermost loop (about the better use of the index j).


Why not replace Vector::scale by Vector::operator *= ?


Use the commented-out version in PreconditionBlock::invert_diagblocks
  using the try-catch clauses


GrowingVectorMemory is not thread-safe. Use a Mutex to fix this.


Implement "use the length of the computed orthogonal residual" in the
  BiCGStab method.
