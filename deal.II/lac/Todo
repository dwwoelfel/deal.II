Use unsigned integers for the colnums array in dSMatrixStruct. This
  would enhance safety since colnum=-1 would no longer point to a
  valid address. Mark unused values by numeric_limits<uint>::max
  (or some such constant) instead, which probably has the same
  bit representation as (uint)-1, but is an unsigned, therefore
  eliminating the need for conversions.


Make ILU decomposition faster by following the comment in the
  innermost loop (about the better use of the index j).


Why not replace Vector::scale by Vector::operator *= ?


Use the commented-out version in PreconditionBlock::invert_diagblocks
  using the try-catch clauses


Someone should take a look at the handling of the sparsity variable
  in the sparse matrix: it is subscribed to twice (explicitely and 
  through the subscriptor); the explicit subscription is redundant,
  but I don't have the time to look into that now.


Change the threaded* functions of the SparseMatrix to return void
  instead of void* when the respective classes in ThreadManager are
  updated.
