====== Things to be done for the lac library     ================
=================================================================

Let all the reinit functions in /lac free their memory, if reinit
  is called with the given dimension is zero. If so, check all deal.II files
  for use of reinit. (At present, new dimension==0 is not allowed.)
  [Done for dFMatrix and dVector; still to be done for the other
  classes.]

Use unsigned integers for the colnums array in dSMatrixStruct. This
  would enhance safety since colnum=-1 would no longer point to a
  valid address. How do you mark non-used columns? (gk)


Let dSMatrixStruct::compress free the memory of colnums which is
  no longer needed.
