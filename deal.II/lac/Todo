Make ILU decomposition faster by following the comment in the
  innermost loop (about the better use of the index j).


Why not replace Vector::scale by Vector::operator *= ?


Use the commented-out version in PreconditionBlock::invert_diagblocks
  using the try-catch clauses


Someone should take a look at the handling of the sparsity variable
  in the sparse matrix: it is subscribed to twice (explicitely and 
  through the subscriptor); the explicit subscription is redundant,
  but I don't have the time to look into that now.


Change the threaded* functions of the SparseMatrix to return void
  instead of void* when the respective classes in ThreadManager are
  updated.
