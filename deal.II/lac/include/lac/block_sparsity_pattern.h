/**
 * This is the base class for block versions of the sparsity pattern and
 * compressed sparsity pattern classes. It has not much functionality, but
 * only administrates an array of sparsity pattern objects and delegates work
 * to them. It has mostly the same interface as has the SparsityPattern,
 * CompressedSparsityPattern, and CompressedSetSparsityPattern classes, and
 * simply transforms calls to its member functions to calls to the respective
 * member functions of the member sparsity patterns.
 *
 * The largest difference between the SparsityPattern and
 * CompressedSparsityPattern classes and this class is that
 * mostly, the matrices have different properties and you will want to
 * work on the blocks making up the matrix rather than the whole
 * matrix. You can access the different blocks using the
 * <tt>block(row,col)</tt> function.
 *
 * Attention: this object is not automatically notified if the size of
 * one of its subobjects' size is changed. After you initialize the
 * sizes of the subobjects, you will therefore have to call the
 * <tt>collect_sizes()</tt> function of this class! Note that, of course, all
 * sub-matrices in a (block-)row have to have the same number of rows, and
 * that all sub-matrices in a (block-)column have to have the same number of
 * columns.
 *
 * You will in general not want to use this class, but one of the
 * derived classes.
