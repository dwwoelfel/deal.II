				      * The first two parameters

				      * C-style array, or any other
				      * iterator satisfying the
				      * requirements of a forward
				      * iterator. The objects pointed
				      * to by these iterators
				      * (i.e. what we get after
				      * applying @p{operator*} or
				      * @p{operator->} to one of these
				      * iterators) must be a container
				      * itself that provides functions
				      * @p{begin} and @p{end}
				      * designating a range of
				      * iterators that describe the
				      * contents of one
				      * line. Dereferencing these
				      * inner iterators must either
				      * yield a pair of an unsigned
				      * integer as column index and a
				      * value of arbitrary type (such
				      * a type would be used if we
				      * wanted to describe a sparse
				      * matrix with one such object),
				      * or simply an unsigned integer
				      * (of we only wanted to describe
				      * a sparsity pattern). The
				      * function is able to determine
				      * itself whether an unsigned
				      * integer or a pair is what we
				      * get after dereferencing the
				      * inner iterators, through some
				      * template magic.
				      *
				      * While the order of the outer
				      * iterators denotes the
				      * different rows of the matrix,
				      * the order of the inner
				      * iterator denoting the columns
				      * does not matter, as they are
				      * sorted internal to this
				      * function anyway.
				      *
				      * Since that all sounds very
				      * complicated, consider the
				      * following example code, which
				      * may be used to fill a sparsity
				      * pattern:
				      * @begin{verbatim}
				      * std::vector<std::vector<unsigned int> > column_indices (n_rows);
				      * for (unsigned int row=0; row<n_rows; ++row)
				      *         // generate necessary columns in this row
				      *   fill_row (column_indices[row]);
				      *
				      * sparsity.copy_from (n_rows, n_cols,
				      *                     column_indices.begin(),
				      *                     column_indices.end());
				      * @end{verbatim}
				      *
				      * Note that this example works
				      * since the iterators
				      * dereferenced yield containers
				      * with functions @p{begin} and
				      * @p{end} (namely
				      * @p{std::vector}s), and the
				      * inner iterators dereferenced
				      * yield unsigned integers as
				      * column indices. Note that we
				      * could have replaced each of
				      * the two @p{std::vector}
				      * occurrences by @p{std::list},
				      * and the inner one by
				      * @p{std::set} as well.
				      *
				      * Another example would be as
				      * follows, where we initialize a
				      * whole matrix, not only a
				      * sparsity pattern:
				      * @begin{verbatim}
				      * std::vector<std::map<unsigned int,double> > entries (n_rows);
				      * for (unsigned int row=0; row<n_rows; ++row)
				      *         // generate necessary pairs of columns
				      *         // and corresponding values in this row
				      *   fill_row (entries[row]);
				      *
				      * sparsity.copy_from (n_rows, n_cols,
				      *                     column_indices.begin(),
				      *                     column_indices.end());
				      * matrix.reinit (sparsity);
				      * matrix.copy_from (column_indices.begin(),
				      *                   column_indices.end());
				      * @end{verbatim}
				      *
				      * This example works because
				      * dereferencing iterators of the
				      * inner type yields a pair of
				      * unsigned integers and a value,
				      * the first of which we take as
				      * column index. As previously,
				      * the outer @p{std::vector}
