This directory tests the testsuite, not the deal.II library! It should
not be included in the regular regression test runs!

Things that should be checked for when changing the implementation of
the test suite:

1. After make clean, first and second run should produce same results
2. Tests with even number should produce same results as previous odd number
3. Tests should produce results as indicated by their name



Remarks on the implementation

The file phony.h is used to make sure compilation is started in EVERY
run of make for targets with even numbers.

The current use of phony.h makes 'make report' report a wrong result
for ok_02. While this is not a problem as long as we know it, we must
be aware of it when changing the implementation.
