The  example  applications  in  the  subdirectories  (apart  from  the
'step-by-step'  directory) were  written in  the early  stages  of the
library  and served  more  the  task of  verification  than as  proper
examples. For this  reason, they are not very  well documented and are
probably no good examples anyway.

One, the multigrid example, does not even what its name may suggest.

We  excuse   for  the  fact  that   they  might  not   serve  as  good
examples. Better  ones are planned and  in parts written,  but not yet
available at present. Sorry.
