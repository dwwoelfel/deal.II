DEAL.II TESTSUITE README
========================

Subdirectories in this tree contain test programs for various features
of base lac and deal.II libraries.

All features of deal that should be available in future releases
should be tested here.

Run make in this directory to do all tests. This is required before
any commit to the CVS repository.

How to interpret the output?
----------------------------

Apart from several messages containing compiling and linking
information, the output of make will contain lines like

=====Running======== heavy.testcase
=====OK=============

If the second line is replaced by some diff-output, please check for
consistency. A check-in of the modified results should be considered
carefully.
