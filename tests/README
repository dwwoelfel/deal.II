DEAL.II TESTSUITE README
========================

Subdirectories in this tree contain test programs for various features
of base lac and deal.II libraries.

All features of deal that should be available in future releases
should be tested here.

Run make in this directory to do all tests. This is required before
any commit to the CVS repository.

How to interpret the output?
----------------------------

Apart from several messages containing compiling and linking
information, the output of make will contain lines like

=====Running======== heavy.testcase
=====OK=============

If the second line is replaced by some diff-output, please check for
consistency. A check-in of the modified results should be considered
carefully.

Running the tests on a new platform
-----------------------------------

1) Link the subdirectory in results, matching your platform most closely
   to a directory ./compare.
2) Run the tests and check the results.
3) Run 'make resultname' and remember the output $N
4a) if all results are good edit Makefile in results and add a link to
    $N. Edit .cvsignore accordingly.
4b) else, create a directory in results named $N and add it to cvs.
4c) if all results in a subdirectory are ok, do the link thing in 4a
    for the subdir.
4d) else continue with 5
5) Run make output in the subdirectories necessary.
6) Create subdirectories in results/$N named as in tests and copy
   the output files there. Add them to cvs. Consider links for large
   coinciding files.
7) Check in. Remove the link compare and the results subdirectory.
8) cvs update -d
9) Run the tests to see if everything works.
