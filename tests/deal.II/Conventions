Conventions for the /tests/deal.II directory:
=============================================

Since the files in this directory may need to be linked against one or
more of the deal_II_?d.[g.]a libraries and since we do not want to
specify this in the Makefile explicitely, please use the following two
lines somewhere in the .cc file for the respective testcase:

// deal_II_libraries.g=-ldeal_II_2d.g
// deal_II_libraries=-ldeal_II_2d

Respectively, if the program needs to be linked with the 3d library,
replace 2d by 3d. If the program needs to be linked against both, then
write 

// deal_II_libraries.g=-ldeal_II_2d.g -ldeal_II_3d.g
// deal_II_libraries=-ldeal_II_2d -ldeal_II_3d


East test case shall give its output (apart from errors) to
'cout'. For each test case, there shall be a file with the name of the
test case and the extension '.expect' which contains the output that
we expect if program and library are working as expected. The actual
output of the program is autoamtically compared against this file.
