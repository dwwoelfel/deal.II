Issues:

 - PORTING:
   The big part. Bruno and I have converted all the tests, but there a a
   lot that need some love. It would be very nice if anybody who has a
   spare minute
  
     - installs numdiff (http://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/)
     - sets up the testsuite to a category
         TEST_PICKUP_REGEX="category/"
     - fixes all the failing tests :-]
     - marks the category as done in ./tests/TODO

 - CLEANUP:
   Clean up tests under deal.II/ and bits/ - rearrange category:
   For somehow decent performance with GNU make there shouldn't be more
   than 300 .output-files in a given category. Some of the tests under
   deal.II and bits really look like they belong to somewhere else?
   We now have the opportunity to rearrange this a bit. Opinions?

 - ISSUE:
   p4est's vtk write out may be with zlib support - independent of how
   deal.II is actually configured. With this, a lot of tests under
   distributed_grids/ fail.

 - ISSUE:
   Depending on the version of boost, a version number in the serialization
   output changes and all tests just under serialization/ just fail

 - Mesh converter tests?

 - Benchmark should be extra, am I right?
