Issues:

 - CLEANUP:
   Clean up tests under deal.II/ and bits/ - rearrange category:
   For somehow decent performance with GNU make there shouldn't be more
   than 300 .output-files in a given category. Some of the tests under
   deal.II and bits really look like they belong to somewhere else?
   We now have the opportunity to rearrange this a bit. Opinions?

 - ISSUE:
   p4est's vtk write out may be with zlib support - independent of how
   deal.II is actually configured. With this, a lot of tests under
   distributed_grids/ fail.

 - ISSUE:
   Quite some tests that use PETSc depend on specific external packages,
   e.g. hypre and mumps

 - Mesh converter tests?

 - Benchmark should be extra, am I right?
