Issues:

 - p4est's vtk write out may be with zlib support - independent of how
   deal.II is actually configured. With this, a lot of tests under
   distributed_grids fail.

 - Depending on the version of boost, a version number in the serialization
   output changes and all tests just.. fail

 - Mesh converter tests?

 - Benchmark tests?

 - What about the files in

   ./base/data_out_base_dx
   ./base/data_out_base_povray

 - Relocate all meshes in ./deal.II/*/ to ./deal.II/grids
