# The "loginfo" file is used to control where "cvs commit" log information is
# sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, the remainder of the line is a
# filter program that should expect log information on its standard input
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in the
# first field of this file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
#
# The filter program may use one and only one "%s" modifier (ala printf).  If
# such a "%s" is specified in the filter program, a brief title is included
# (as one argument, enclosed in single quotes) showing the relative directory
# name and listing the modified file names.
#
# For example:
#
DEFAULT		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/default.html > /tmp/Tdefault; mv /tmp/Tdefault $CVSROOT/LOG/default.html
#
# The various DEAL libraries
#
^base.*		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/base.html > /tmp/Tbase; mv /tmp/Tbase $CVSROOT/LOG/base.html
#
^reports.*		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/reports.html > /tmp/Treports; mv /tmp/Treports $CVSROOT/LOG/reports.html
#
^tests.*		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/tests.html > /tmp/Ttests; mv /tmp/Ttests $CVSROOT/LOG/tests.html
#
^lac.*		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/lac.html > /tmp/Tlac; mv /tmp/Tlac $CVSROOT/LOG/lac.html
#
^deal.*		(echo $USER %s; date; cat) | /home/people/cvs/script/log.pl | cat - $CVSROOT/LOG/deal.html > /tmp/Tdeal; mv /tmp/Tdeal $CVSROOT/LOG/deal.html
#
